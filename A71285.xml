            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ine years, or there about, are pas't, Since Dr Edward Stillingfleet ſet <note place="margin">Printed Anno 1669</note> forth à voluminous book, entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>A rational Account of the grounds of Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, to the view and examination of others. Many both learned and judicious, have in their ſeveral latter works, diſcovered here and there, no Small, but great Errours in it. Among the reſt, one worthy man not ſcared with the fearful bulk of the book, fixed upon the <hi>whole,</hi> engaged to examin it, and to return the Dr à full, just, and compleat Anſwer, but it pleaſed God to call him out of this world before he ſaw an end of his labours. VVhile he yet lived buſy at work, I ventured upon the chiefeſt Points of Controverſy han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, not willing to meddle with the whole book, becauſe another had it in hand. I thought then, and do ſo still, that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet came much too short of à right Reckoning <note place="margin">The one Printed Anno 1668 The other, 1672</note> in his Account, and therefore plainly laid down his Mistakes and errours in two Treatiſes. <hi>Proteſtancy without Principles. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Religion</hi> &amp;c. Ever ſince, year after year, I expected the good hour, when Mr
<pb facs="tcp:93042:3"/> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> vvould pleaſe to juſt Accounts vvith me, for he had been long in debt, and give (like à good Correſpondent) ſatisfaction to the many exceptions I made againſt his <hi>Account.</hi> At laſt, two other books containing his after Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings appear, not like the grand volume Bulkie, and ſo far praiſe vvorthy, who ever ſaies more to their commendation loſes credit vvith me. VVhen theſe books came to my hands, one long after the other (the diſtance of place vvould have it ſo) I read all, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every particular diligently, still hopeing, as I vvent along to find the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> more rational, and better at his Reckonings now, then he had been in his former VVritings, but after an exact peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, I ſaw clearly my hopes fruſtrated, and Dr Still: juſt like himſelfe, not only unmethodical, but beſides à meer Shuffler in the main matter he vvas obliged to give Account of, as vvill be made out hereafter. The firſt of his volumes is called. <hi>An anſwer to ſeveral Treatiſes, occaſioned by à book</hi> &amp;c. The other beares the name <hi>of à Diſcourſe, in vindication of the Proteſtant grounds of Faith, againſt the pretence of Infallibility in the Roman Church, in Anſwer to the Guide of Controverſies by. R. H. Proteſtancy without Principles and Reaſon and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or the certain Rule of Faith by. E. W. with à particular Enquiry into the Miracles of the Roman Church.</hi> In
<pb facs="tcp:93042:3"/> theſe Treatiſes, where Mr Dr should have made a right Reckoning with his Creditors, (thoſe I mean who truſted him with the beſt wares they had) he in recompence fall's into hitter fitts of paſſion, and railing at them, One is blind, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other has neither fear nor wit, à third is à popish Leviathan &amp;c. And thus hurried on (you shall have the liſt of his obloquies more compleat preſently) he thinks not one only, but <note place="margin">Se the Dr's general Preface</note> all he deals with halfe martyred by him, and that none has more felt the weight of his heavy hand, than E. W. To give the man his due, if curſt language can kill one, he has behaved himſelfe ſtoutly, and knock't E. W. down (more like à Wood-river with à beetle, than à Scholar by ſtrong Arguments) à hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times over, yet thanks be to God. E. W. is alive, well able to keep Accounts with the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, whoſe furious Doings and feeble pen Labour, he fear's not. For proof hereof, I remit you, Gentle Reader, to the following Treatiſe. Peruſe and cenſure freely; I appeal to your Iudgement.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, it will not me thinks be amiſs, for the better clearing of Accounts between the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> and me, to preacquaint you with ſome few, yet real exceptions, I juſtly make againſt an very ill Reſpondent. A main one is, that as you ſe by the Dr's Title, he pretend's to anſwer my two laſt Books already named, whereas the Contrary is evident, and proved in
<pb facs="tcp:93042:4"/> this Treatiſe. <hi>He anſwers nothing,</hi> nor ſo much as offer's to meddle with ſuch matters as are deſervedly eſteemed by all Polemical writers the moſt ſubſtantial, or of greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. For example. I told the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as any man can ſpeak, that never Book merited leſs the Title, than his <hi>Rational Account of the grounds of Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and upon this very account I excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, both againſt the <hi>Book</hi> and Author, and ſaid, that the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> never yet went about to tell us, what is meant <hi>by his Proteſtancy,</hi> much leſs to ſettle one Tenet of it upon any <hi>Principle, expreſs Scripture, univerſal Tradition, or the Authority of any Church held Orthodox by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <note place="margin">Reaſ and Relig: 1. c. 20. and Diſc. 3. c. 18.</note> world.</hi> Not à word of anſwer hath the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> returned to this moſt juſt and urgent exception. Beſides I told him, that his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy which he ſuppoſes well grounded, want's the very <hi>Eſſence of Religion,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſubſiſt's upon no grounds; and that in Proteſtancy, as it is distinguished from Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion, and all known condemned Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, there is not ſo much as one Article re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by Almighty God, taught by any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Church or Iudged by the Profeſſors of this <hi>Novelty,</hi> neceſſary to Salvation. This I thought, and think ſtill, à charge very Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, yet Mr D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> waves it, not becauſe he deem's it little (for nothing can be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb facs="tcp:93042:4"/> to Proteſtancy) but becauſe he knowes not what to anſwer. Yet more. Proteſtants grant, and ſo far the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſides vvith them, that the Roman Catholick Church once pure in Faith, ſincerely conveyed to poſterity the great Myſteries concerning Chriſtian Religion, of the <hi>ſacred Trinity, the Incarnation,</hi> the <hi>Reſurrection of the dead</hi> &amp;c, but ſay withall, that after ſo much good ſervice done, She perverſty brought in, and publickly taught (contrary to truth) many both new and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous doctrins. <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints,</hi> and <hi>Purgatory,</hi> with à mighty deluge of other groſs errours. I have amply proved this charge of errours; and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of Religion, entring à whole Church, to be utterly impoſsible, and rely upon an undubitable <note place="margin">Proteſt: without Princ: Diſc. 3. C. 13. n. 5.</note> Principle. Viz. Theſe Suppoſed Novelties being plain matters of Fact, could never get into Christianity, without <hi>publick Defence</hi> in thoſe who firſt broached them, and <hi>publick Reſiſtance</hi> in others, that (had they been errours) <hi>publickly oppoſed them;</hi> but never Since Chriſt's time, was there any ſuch publick defence, or publick oppoſition as is largely proved in the place now cited. Here I add one Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration more. Sectaries who lay this foul aſperſion on the Church muſt Iudge the whole body of Chriſtians, <hi>Princes, Prelates</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> all over <hi>Germany, Italy, Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> &amp;c stark madd at once,
<pb facs="tcp:93042:5"/> that is, to have unanimouſly conſpired in à beliefe of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, (for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)</hi> never held before, and this is as great à Paradox, as if you Should ſuppoſe, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks now, might univerſally agree in one beliefe, and ſtedfaſtly maintain, that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Baptiſm is really Chriſt's ſacred blood as vvorthy Adoration, as à Conſecrated Chali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce is; yet (and here is the wonder) no man, forſooth, muſt be thought to take the leaſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſo univerſal à dotage, nor of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious change made in Christian Religion by it. Tell me, Courteous Reader, were ſuch à Novelty brought this preſent year into the Church, would not Iewes, Turks, Heathens and all Hereticks (if none els did it) raiſe loud Clamours againſt the great body of Chriſtians, obſerve all that's done, and ieer at us in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Streets? On the other ſide, if Sectaries ſay, theſe ſuppoſed Innovations were firſt begun by Some few, two or three in corners, got growth in time, and at laſt became believed Articles of Faith all over the Christian world; I anſwer, this is more impoſſible, yea the greatest Chimaera Imaginable. Viz. That ſuch groſs Novelties should ſteal into à Church, and be publickly taught by à few, vvithout oppoſition or notice taken by other ſound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, far more numerous and learned (for now we ſuppoſe, all ran not mad at once). Here alſo the Inſtance already given, has the like force. Should à few men in à town or City publickly
<pb facs="tcp:93042:5"/> teach that the water in Baptiſm is Christ's real blood, would not the whole Body of ſound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, both cenſure and decry the errour as hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and blaſphemous? Nothing can be more evident. Beſides, all know, how exact the Church of Chriſt has been in condemning Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies as they roſe up, the time when they began, and the Perſons that introduced them, remain ſtill upon record, but here are Novelties ſpoken of, and unworthily charged upon à whole Church, <hi>yet huſh!</hi> All paſſed in ſilence, no man men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions them, no Author friend or Enemy left them upon Record. The D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> may remember, how he impugn's that matter of fact concerning the miraculous Tranſlation <hi>of the houſe of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Diſc. 2. P. 451.</note> 
                     <hi>Loreto</hi> from Nazareth, where he tells us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe three Authors, <hi>Dantes, Petrach,</hi> and <hi>Boccace</hi> men most inquiſitive, omitted to mention it, the wholy Story was to be thought an incredible fiction. But here à <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> and of far greater concern, <hi>the palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble change of Chriſtian Doctrin</hi> from what it was anciently, is ſuppoſed to enter the world, not mentioned by any one Author friend or enemy, Therefore according to the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, it is to be judged à forged tale, à meer whimſy, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and incredible. Much more then this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to, I urged against the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, and here remind him of his grand Omiſsion, for to this very day, though he pretend's to anſwer my book's, yet be never medled with this one point, moſt weighty, and of greateſt
<pb facs="tcp:93042:6"/> Importance. I call it <hi>weighty,</hi> for upon theſe unanſwerable proofs, Proteſtancy is ruin'd, and the Church no leſſe demonſtratively clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from that unjuſt calumny of altering Her Doctrin, which She received from Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>But the greatest Omiſſion of all, where the Dr's dull proceeding with me appear's moſt, remain's yet untouched. Thoſe who have read my laſt Treatiſes know, that the chiefeſt thing I inſiſted upon, and aimed at, was to prove <note place="margin">Protes: without Princ: Diſc. 1. c. 2. n. 9.</note> à Truth which muſt ſtand, or Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion fall's to nothing. It is, <hi>the Roman Catholick Churches Infallibility in every Doctrin She obliges Chriſtians to believe.</hi> I told the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> if all Paſtors all Bishops, and the Church with them, be ſo falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in delivering Chriſtian Doctrin, that when it is ultimately applyed to the Hearers, the Doctrin may be falſe, God never ſent them to teach it. I proved the Aſſertion. God ſent not Christ our Lord, nor Chriſt his Apoſtles, nor the Apoſtles others, to teach any Doctrin but that which relies upon the <hi>firſt Verity</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly revealing truth, but ſuch à Doctrin can neither be fallible nor falſe, but moſt true and infallible, if therefore the Church teaches not that Doctrin as it is <hi>true</hi> and <hi>Infallible,</hi> but may change it into meer fallible and perhaps falſe Doctrin, She ceaſes, <hi>eo ipſo,</hi> to be à Church, and all the Doctors that teach ſo, are
<pb facs="tcp:93042:6"/> no Catholick Doctors. Moreover I ſaid, If <note place="margin">Reaſ: and Relig: Diſc. 2. c. 19. n. 12.</note> God hath not purpoſely made Religion à matter of eternal debate; if he has not caſt Chriſtians upon endleſs vncertainties what to believe; if both the <hi>Truth and infallibility</hi> of his revealed Doctrin, ſtand firmly upon the firſt Verity (not ſeparable there) and be revealed <hi>for this end,</hi> that all aſſent to it, as it is <hi>true and Infallible;</hi> If finally the very funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Faith neceſſary for Salvation, as regiſtred in <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> be ſtill liable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes amongst the learned of different Religion; If theſe things be, as they all are, clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences; Nothing can be more manifeſt, than that the All-ſeing Providence hath impowred ſome Oracle, to compoſe ſuch ſtrifes raiſed among Chriſtians, and to teach Chriſt's Doctrin as it deſerves to be taught, <hi>truly and infallibly.</hi> Theſe Arguments with many others not to be repeated, I have clearly propoſed, and often Called on Mr D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> to reply, but in the very nick and occaſion when he found himſelfe obliged to anſwer, he warily ſlip's aſide to another By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtion about the reſolution of Faith, and there, forſooth, becauſe the matter of its own nature is hard, and ſpeculative, not eaſily underſtood by every vulgar Reader, he thought he might well lie hid, free from the Cenſure of ſuch men whom he court's, though he ſpeake, as be often doth plainly from the purpoſe. VVhereas, had he proceeded downright, and directly fallen
<pb facs="tcp:93042:7"/> upon my reaſons alledged in behalfe of the Churches <hi>Infallibility,</hi> every judicious Reader (though little verſed in ſpeculative Learning) would have ſoon ſeen, whether of us (I in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing or he in his anſwers) deſerved reproof, and stood grounded upon better Principles. Notwithſtanding this pretty Subterfuge, the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> hath got little by waving the main Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <note place="margin">Reaſ: and Relig: Diſc. 2. c. 5. n. 5.</note> for I have followed him cloſely in the Speculative matter he lead's me to, and made it manifeſt, that he neither bitt's upon the right reſolution of Faith, nor indeed underſtand's where the real difficulty lies. One thing yet remain's, and I much wonder the Dr never medled with it. I ſaid, who ever impeaches the Roman Catholick Church of errour in points of Faith, is ſure to be worſted in every rational Conteſt held upon that ſubiect, and ought to own the <hi>ſuppoſed errour</hi> ſo remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs an <hi>Evil,</hi> that it muſt remain as it is, without all hope of bettering it. The Aſſertion ſtand's firm upon this ground. No man can rationally charge errour upon à whole Church (never cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by any in former Ages, but known and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Hereticks) without Principles more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, vveighty, and ponderous than the Churches <hi>Sole Authority is.</hi> But there are no Principles in <hi>Being</hi> powerful enough to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold any ſuch diſcourſe; and not to make long vvork about à manifeſt Truth, pray tell me, vvhither can the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> goe for Principles, vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Church is proved ſo <hi>much as liable
<pb facs="tcp:93042:7"/> to errour?</hi> Will he take recourſe to the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous conſent of Fathers? The attempt is deſperate, while they generally teach quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Doctrin, as is amply proved in my two laſt Treatiſes. Nay more, can the Dr produce <note place="margin">Se Reas: and Relig: Diſc: 2. c. 14. n. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I will return him hearty thanks if he point out one, but ſuppoſe (which is falſe) one or two glance at any ſuch thing, have their doubtful words, thinke ye, force enough to Counterpoiſe the Authority of So renowned an Oracle as this Church is? Say I beſeech you, what if one or two English Dr's should boldly tell us, that the nine and thirty Articles are matters of Divine Faith, and that all vvho teach the Doctrin, are by Divine Aſſiſtance made Infallible Oracles, is this ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to overthrow the Sentiment of the vvhole English Church, vvhich hold's Herſelfe <hi>fallible</hi> in delivering the Doctrin She maintains? No certainly. Much leſs, ſay I, can the Authority of one or two Fathers, only ſuppoſed (not proved) of à different opinion in judging the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church <hi>errable,</hi> availe one whit to make it probable, that She is guilty of errour or liable to it, when contrary to Proteſtants, both She and all the learned Dr's of one Faith with her, boldly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert She cannot erre. Hence I infer, that no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority taken from this or that ancient Father, much leſs from this or that private man, can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally oppoſe the Church in her juſt claim to Infallibility,</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:93042:8"/>
                  <p>The next Principle the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> and others uſe to rely on, is taken from General Councils appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Church. How I beſeech you, or in what manner? Did any Council ever yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly define, that the Church can err? You will ſay no, but theſe Councils contradict one another, and no infallible Oracle doth ſo. <hi>The weakeſt Pretence and leaſt worth of any.</hi> For doth not Holy Scripture alſo ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly ſpeak contradictions in many Paſſages? You will ſay, though they appear like Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, yet learned men have already cleared ſuch Antilogies. Beſides Scripture is God's word, and all know that God cannot contradict himſelfe. Very right; this is my Anſwer alſo. The learned of our Church have over and over cleared all ſuch paſſages in Councils as appear to ſome short ſighted eyes contradictions, from all oppoſition, and we more aſſuredly know, that the Roman Catholick Church is God's own infallible Oracle, than any Sectary can shew by reaſon, that Scripture is the word of God, or written by <hi>Divine Inſpiration.</hi> Pleaſe now to compare Principles together. The Dr im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaches this Church of errour, and takes his proofs from the ſeeming Contradictions of Councils. A Catholick Adverſary no leſs learned than he, ſolves all the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Obiects. The Church, while theſe two Combatants are hot at vvork, stand's by, and poſitively declares, She never delivered contrary Doctrin in any
<pb facs="tcp:93042:8"/> of her Councils. <hi>Here is the Clear Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Principle.</hi> Against this Principle the Dr makes his exceptions, which thouſands and thouſands as learned as he, judge to be fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, forceleſs, and long ſince ruined Fallacies. The Queſtion is now, and tis worth the while to drive it on further, becauſe it is moſt uſeful in all debates with Sectaries. <hi>The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion I ſay is,</hi> vvho shall judge in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt between the Church and this Dr, vvith all his exceptions? Have vve means to know vvho ſpeaks truth in ſo vveighty à matter, and upon vvhom the errour lies? To clear this you shall ſe how indifferently I proceed, I will as yet, neither ſuppoſe the Church nor the Dr blamable, but leave this to the juſt trial of ſome Iudge, let that Iudge be named, and much is done. The Church never cenſured by any Orthodox Christian, and defended by the moſt learned in the world, think's her own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity worth ſomething, and powerful enough to bear up her cauſe against à ſingle Dr, with all his crew of Sectaries, but let that be yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable, whither will the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> lead us for à final Sentence in this yet debatable caſe? Has he any <hi>ancient Church,</hi> any <hi>conſent of Fathers,</hi> any <hi>one word</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> any <hi>received Tradition,</hi> whereby he evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Church errable in her Councils. Theſe are excellent Principles, but I abſolutely aſſert he has none of them; not one vvas ever yet
<pb facs="tcp:93042:9"/> produced by him, nor shall hereafter be brought to light while the world ſtands, as is clearly made out both in this, and my former Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Contrarywiſe, it is certain that the Church and all her learned Doctors plead ſtrongly by every one of theſe Principles, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore She ſtand's upon ſurer grounds than the Dr, vvho as, I now ſaid, has none of them. The Dr may reply, Theſe very Scriptures and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Church plead's by for her not erring, are only doubtful proofs, and therefore convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce nothing. I anſwer if theſe be doubtful, the Dr's Aſſertion, vvhile he ſaith <hi>They are doubtful,</hi> is I am ſure <hi>no ſelfe-evident</hi> Truth, but (either utterly falſe) or at leaſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully doubtful, and therefore muſt be proved by à ſtronger Principle, than his own proofleſs vvord. Leave us not now, Mr D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, give us, I beſeech you, ſome light of that Principle, or ultimate proof, vvhereby it may appear, that you ſpeak truth, or ſo much as Sence vvhen you tell us: <hi>All our proofs alledged in behalfe of the Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, are doubtfull and controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> Name the Church, the Fathers, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils (Scripture you have none) that ſpeak as you do. You may introduce Sectaries vvho ſay ſo, but they come unarmed vvithout Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Church-authority, Fathers, or Tradition, and to theſe <hi>(men of yeſterday),</hi> vve oppoſe thouſands more ancient on our ſide. Thus,
<pb facs="tcp:93042:9"/> Mr D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, we proceed in every other particular Controverſy, and will shew you when you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, ſo non-plus't, and ſoon driven to an end of all diſcourſe for want of Principles, <hi>that the ultimate proofs of your Aſſertions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you defend Proteſtancy, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn</hi>

The ground I ſtand upon is ſolid, and in à vvord thus. All Principles imaginable (plain Scripture excepted vvhereof there is no danger) thought fit to carry on à diſcourſe againſt our Churches Doctrin, vvill be at the very most, (if they get ſo high) du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious only and uncertain, vſually polish't with Sectaries gloſſes, But it is evident, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled Gloſſes ſet upon doubtful Authorities, are too trivial and forceleſs to vveaken or to diſcountenance à long ſtanding Church in the just claim she laies to Infallibility, She <hi>by her Selfe,</hi> is ſtrong enough to vvithſtand ſuch fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Effort's,</hi> and more than theſe come to, <hi>you never yet had,</hi> nor shall have <hi>hereafter</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:93042:10"/> from Sectaries. Nothing therefore ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me more ſimple and ſensleſs, than is the deſperate attempt of Novelliſts, vvho vvill, forſooth, reform à Church <hi>in points of Faith,</hi> before they have ſo much as probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their own halfe <hi>well-done</hi> Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; But this, (though exception enough) is not all, there is yet more against them. Obſerve vvell. Sectaries are confeſſedly falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and upon that account, may not only ſpoil all they take in hand to mend, but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpeaking, ſeem neceſſitated to do ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing in nature <hi>(or what reaſon dictates)</hi> nothing in Grace <hi>(or what God hath revealed)</hi> nothing that Antiquity ever taught, can yeild them ſo much as the leaſt <hi>glimpſe</hi> of any Principle, to reform the Church by. O! this want of Principles ruin's our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hence proceed's his intolerable Shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, his empty diſpirited, and faint strain in writing, all along as viſible to à judicious Reader, as the paper is be cast's his eyes upon; All along, lame and halting, yet hauty <hi>(that muſt help out)</hi> and diſdainful.

(and you muſt ſay it) that theſe Suppoſed groſs and open violations, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their living in the <hi>true eſſential way to Salvation,</hi> thoſe who follow this way are in ſpight of all oppoſition in <hi>à ſafe and moſt ſecure way,</hi> becauſe, as I ſaid, the true way <hi>is ſafe</hi> and cannot damn any, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their lives and actions to it. Your errour, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, lies here, that you unwartly ſtretc'h theſe ſuppoſed violations too farr, and make them do what they cannot do; That is not only to <hi>Obſtruct,</hi> but alſo to <hi>cut off.</hi> the true way of Salvation from Catholicks, which is impoſſible, unleſs you deſtroy your own ground <hi>and Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> with it, in granting plainly, they may be ſaved in their Religion. What I aſſert here is evident. Lay before you, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, on the one ſide, all thoſe errours or actions you account groſs. <hi>Worſhipping Images, Idolatry, praying to Saints, Tranſubſtantiation</hi> with the reſt, and diſtinguish well between theſe, and thoſe other you call <hi>the Eſſentials of Faith</hi> owned and believed by all Catholicks. The belief of theſe Eſſentials, and living Conformable to them can damn none, as you grant. I ask now, whether their <hi>worſhipping Images,</hi> their <hi>maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Tranſubſtantiation</hi> &amp;c. put's them in à
<pb facs="tcp:93042:13"/> damnable condition, or openly hazard's their Salvation? Affirm; and you hurry them, <hi>eo ipſo</hi> out of the <hi>true way,</hi> vvhich yet you, and your Bishop freely allow them to vvalk in. Say contrary, that the Particular Tenents now mentioned, damn them not, your Iudgement of Charity, leaves them ſtill in the true vvay to Salvation vvhich cannot, if followed, but ſave them, <hi>unleſs you will have them ſaved and damned at once, Saved; by the true way they follow, and damned alſo by reaſon of their particular Tenents.</hi> This diſcourſe I hold demonstrative, and ſo I do all the reſt, ſtrongly propoſed by. I. W. againſt your <note place="margin">P. 19.</note> empty way in anſwering his Arguments. Now one vvord briefly to your <hi>judgement of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> You account this Adverſary diſingenuous becauſe, ſay you, <hi>he barely oppoſes à jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of Charity concerning their Church, to à Iudgement of reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of actions.</hi> A more ridiculous diſtinction never came from Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. Firſt, Charity being an act of the Will, judges not, but is ever regulated by à rational prudent judgement, even in circumſtances, when <hi>by errour</hi> vve are deceived, as if one chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably give an Almes to à ſeeming poor man, vvho is à counterfeit, the Iudgement that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates Charity, is both prudent and rational. <hi>Ergo,</hi> vvhen you, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, Iudge Catholicks in à true vvay to Salvation becauſe they ſtill retain
<pb facs="tcp:93042:13"/> the Eſſentials of à true Church, your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>is either prudent and rational,</hi> or your Charity ceaſes to be real Charity. Again, If you prudently judge them in a damnable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by reaſon of their ſuppoſed Idolatry and other wilful errours, its no prudent Charity but madneſs, to allow them Salvation upon any <hi>other account</hi> what ever. So it is, if you judge à vicious abhominable Liver in all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, lyable by his lewd Courſes to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, you cannot by any other prudent rational judement (unleſs he repent) yeild, that he is in the true way of Salvation. But Catholicks, Say you, by reaſon of their groſs and open Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in not obeying the Will of God, are lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to damnation (groſs and open Violations of God's will deſerve no better), Therefore you cannot by any other <hi>prudent rational jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement</hi> grant, that they are in the true way to Salvation. A plain Anſwer to what I Shall now demand will clear the whole matter. Are Catholicks in the true way of Salvation upon their retaining the Eſſentials of Faith and living Conformable to them? This your <hi>prudent and rational Charity</hi> allowes them, or it <hi>allowes nothing.</hi> Again, are they out of the true way to Salvation, or in à dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Condition, by reaſon of their wilful errours and groſs violations of God's will? Admit this alſo, and your prudent rational Charity, quite blown up, vanishes into Smoak, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:93042:14"/> you put men in à State of Salvation who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it not. Here in à vvord, Sr, is à Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma for you and all I vvould ſay. If you, by your prudent rational Charity, judge Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks may be ſaved, notwithſtanding theſe groſſer Violations now mentioned, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by that other judgement of reaſon <hi>Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the nature of actions,</hi> make them lyable to damnation. Contrarywiſe, if by this Iudgement of reaſon, you account them liable to damnation, you cannot, by that other prudent rational judgement of Charity, place them in à State or in à Condition of Salvation. The reaſon hereof is clear: Two quite Contrary Iudgements pronounced vvith the ſame breath, the one tending to damn men, the other to ſave them, in the Same unvariable Circumſtances, cannot be true or reaſonable. The one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt neceſſarily be rash, imprudent, and unreaſonable. Thus much in effect, your learned Adverſary. I. W. by the force of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing extort's from you, Though in ſtead of returning thanks for his pains in laying down your errours, you uſe him more like à ſlave and varlet, than an Ingenuous Adverſary, and this, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, is your ordinary trick, when moſt Pinched, you are then moſt peevish and teſtie, vvith thoſe you deal vvith.

Much more I have to ſay in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of others, moſt notoriouſly injured by this Adverſary. The learned and worthy Doctor. T.

But ſtay Reader, I have all this while caſt an eye upon our Dr's vvritings, to ſe vvhere Satisfaction is given, A. B. vvho excellently vvell makes it out and ſolidly proves, what he aſſerts, Viz. That Dr St: <note place="margin">A.

<pb facs="tcp:93042:15"/> Theſe things and many more would time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit I should inſiſt upon, and muſt though it lengthen's the Preface à little, take notice of one particular, the fouleſt, and moſt groſs, I ever read in any.

Now comes the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> and demand's. <hi>How do They</hi> (the damned) <hi>want the Sacrament of Penance in Hell, for no doubt there is Attrition good ſtore there. The Sacrament of Penance in Hell, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>! Attrition good ſtore in Hell!</hi> I read theſe words with horrour, and ſtand astonish't at this height of ſtupidity. Pray, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, vvho can abſolve in Hell? VVhat Divels? Or who are there capable of Abſolution? Damned Souls? Anſwer I beſeech you. Are ſuch Souls in your opinion capable of Baptiſm, or of that you call the Lords Supper? You will ſay no. In like manner ſay I, and ſpeak with the whole Chriſtian world, they are as uncapable of the Sacrament of Penance. Sacraments, Good Sr, ſerve only for the living on their <hi>way to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:93042:15"/> and benefit none departed this life. O! but Attrition, whereof there is good ſtore in Hell, troubles the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Here you have alſo the like groſs Ignorance, and therefore I anſwer in à word. If the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> call eternal horrour, everlaſting shame, and deſpair, <hi>Attrition,</hi> he may find great ſtore indeed, but theſe miſeries inſeparably attending the damned, are as remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te from that <hi>Attrition</hi> vvhich the Church and Catholicks maintain, as Hell is from Heaven. The Catholick attrition, as the Council now cited, declares, is <hi>Dei donum,</hi> the gift of God wrought in à Soul by the <hi>impulſe, and motion of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and though it tend's upon à leſs perfect Motive than <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,</hi> yet it is à Supernatural Operation. If you, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, ſpeak not of this Attrition, you fight vvith Shadowes, and touch not Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctrin. I might in this place alſo show, how groſly the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> is miſtaken in his quoting <hi>Gregory de Valentia,</hi> but I haſten to my own affaires, and shall briefly tell you, how and in vvhat manner I proceed vvith this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary</p>
                  <p>The D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, you know, hath employed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and time upon two very different Subiects, the one hard and Speculative, the other more eaſy, containing matters of Fact, ſet forth vvith this Title. <hi>An Enquiry into the Miracles of the Church of Rome.</hi> In this firſt Part I follow him as he goes along,
<pb facs="tcp:93042:16"/> and reply to his Cavils, not one I am ſure (if any be worth notice, as few are) is omitted by me. I diſcover alſo his Shuffling, and as occaſion fall's out, mind him here and there of what he should prove, though he never doth it. I shew moreover, that the grand Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he relies on, called <hi>à Faculty of diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> allowed every one to judge of the <hi>Scriptures Sence</hi> in the moſt neceſſary points concerning Salvation, is not only evidently unſound, but likewiſe highly injurious to God, and Truth, for by it he licences every Arian every Anabaptiſt every Fanatick, and Quaker, who have as good diſcerning Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties as the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> can glory in, to uphold that Sence they draw from Scripture, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it as true, though falſe and heretical, and this, forſooth, is done, becauſe malice vvill not brook God's own Oracle to teach, when we ſtand moſt in need of Inſtruction. After my grounds given for the Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, I urge the Doctor to produce à Proof from any received Principle, whereby it may but probably appear, that à Church once confeſſedly Orthodox and right in Faith, <hi>is errable, or ever erred.</hi> In that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Conteſt about Faith tranſcending the certainty of Motives, I evince, that not only the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> doth <hi>de facto,</hi> but all others muſt ſubſcribe to the truth I Propugn, and
<pb facs="tcp:93042:16"/> own it as an undiſputable Verity. Much more I have against the Doctor, better known by à full peruſal of the Treatiſe, than by any Summary laid before the Reader in à short Preface. In caſe he vvill reioyn, I vvish him (vvhat ere becomes of the rest) not to paſs over my tvvo laſt Chapters, where firſt, I largely inſiſt upon that he call's his <hi>rational Evidence</hi> of Christian Religion, which I shew every way defective, and beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des demonſtrate, that the true Evidence for Chriſtianity is not (as the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> would have it) either deſtroyed, or in the leaſt meaſure enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged by the Doctrin of <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> In the <hi>10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                     </hi> and laſt Chapter, I diſcover the Dr's too manifeſt errour in his unskilful charging à vicious Circle on us. while we reſolve our Catholick Faith. I tell him (which he knowes not) what a vicious Circle eſſentially implies, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively clear the Church from all shadow and danger of à Circle. May it pleaſe the Dr to give me Satisfaction in theſe two main matters, now Specified, (My exceptions againſt him are plain) and alſo vouchſafe, to ſolve another difficulty propoſed in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, concerning the means Chriſt has left, to bring all open Diſſenters in the fundamentals of Faith or Neceſſaries for Salvation, to one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, that is, to underſtand the true genuin Sence
<pb facs="tcp:93042:17"/> of God's word, without an Infallible Church. May it, I ſay pleaſe the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> to do only thus much, I will not only highly applaude his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but freely quit him of blame, though he trifle never ſo much with me in his Anſwers to the reſt of this Treatiſe. Now in caſe he take courage to reply (whereof I doubt very much) it is hard to ſay what humour he will be in, what Vizor or Shape he may aſſume. Perchance he vvill appear with his pageant-like piety, and renew his promiſes of vvriting fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as becomes an Ingenuous Adverſary. Very good, if he anſwer as fairly, and home, I am vvell content. It may be quite contrary; he will bear me down vvith bigg vvords, and call me Philoſophical fool, vvitleſs fellow, bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inleſs, Saucy, bold, and all that naught is. No matter, ſay I, if he anſwer's my obiections, I can digeſt all. It may be, he will without much notice taken of my Arguments repeat all, or the moſt he has ſaid already (it is à uſual trick of Sectaries) and entitle that an Anſwer to this Treatiſe, if ſo; he will need no great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phist to lay open the cheat. But what if he take Pet? What if paſſion and ignorance drive him into à humour of Contempt? VVhat if he lay all thought of anſwering aſide, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy ſome few of his own Gange by an odd Querie, as he once did? <hi>Cannot à dull book come out with my name in the Title, but I muſt be obliged to anſwer
<pb facs="tcp:93042:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> it? No, I aſſure them, I know better how to ſpend my time.</hi> Well, Courteous <note place="margin">Part. 1. Page. 72.</note> Reader, if he run this way, I have done, and ſay no more but what all will vow, that the of oyle of the Doctors lampe is well nigh, if not wholly ſpent. Among the many wayes here briefly hinted at, time, I hope, may tell us how he will behave himſelfe. I expect his Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>A word now if, you pleaſe, of what I shall handle hereafter. Dr Still: hath published two ſpiteful ridiculous Treatiſes, juſtly offenſive to every Iudicious man, the one is his ſimple charge of Idolatry shamefully and without jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement laid upon the Roman Catholick Church, thanks be to God he hath been ſoundly baffled for it. The other is his wild Enquiry after Miracles vvrought in the ſame great Moral body of Chriſtians, and this I engage to anſwer, though indeed, the juggling, the palpable So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry, the manifeſt falſities vvherewith that vvhole Diſcourſe is ſeaſoned, return you the beſt Anſwer, and plainly tell you The <hi>Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry made by him,</hi> is in à vvord vvorth nothing, abating this one point, that it expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Author, as he deſerves, to publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. VVhat in Gods name, came into the Dr's head, to vvrite as he hath done againſt all Miracles? Many Protestants, I am ſure (as you shall ſee afterward) ingenuouſly ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novvledge true Miracles to have been vvrought in the Roman Catholick Church, others of the
<pb facs="tcp:93042:19"/> worſer ſort, allow at least an <hi>appearance</hi> of them, though perhaps done by the help of Divels, but the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſeem's in Several Paſſages not to allow us ſo much as the outward Semblance of à Miracle, and all along own's not one of them, <hi>true.</hi> VVhat shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ſay to this man. VVill he grant that the Iewes bad true Miracles among them, and deny the like Grace and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to the Chriſtian Church? VVill he allow the gift of working Miracles to two great Prophets, <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> at their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring again, when the Church will be neer an end, and take from her all Signs, all true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, during the vaſt ſpace of time between the Apostles, and the latter dayes of theſe <hi>two Prophets?</hi> VVill he ſay (and he muſt ſay it) when Antichriſt comes, that, that falſe Prophet will do ſtrange wonders; yea in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance great Miracles, though all rotten and full of guile: and shall Chriſt's own Spouſe, the true Chriſtian Church be ſo abaſed, ſo vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought of, by one that profeſſes Chriſtianity, as never to have vvrought by God's ſpecial favour ſo much as one true Miracle; never to have Shewed any other vvonder but vvhat Divels <hi>have done, and Antichriſt will</hi> do by his charm's, vvhen he comes to delude the vvorld? Gentle Reader, theſe things are horrid; and better befit à Proficient in Atheiſm, than one that bear's the name of à Chriſtian. But more of this in the Treatiſe, vvhere I
<pb facs="tcp:93042:19"/> shall diſcover the Dr's intolerable fraudes which run through his vvhole Diſcourſe, and show alſo, vvhat Catholicks underſtand by Church Miracles vvherein the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> groſly err's, for he thinks every uncertain Story, related by this or that too credulous Author (often cenſured by the Church) paſſes amongst us for à Church Miracle. There is no ſuch matter, the Miracles vve chiefly rely on and defend, are rigidly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, atteſted by oath, and made every way ſo morally certain before they gain Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that no man in prudence can call them into doubt. Thoſe other, related by private Authors, are either <hi>probable, dubious,</hi> or <hi>manifeſtly falſe.</hi> If all Circumſtances Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, they appear <hi>probable,</hi> vve own them as ſuch, and go no further: If <hi>dubious;</hi> vve ſuſpend our judgements and leave them in that uncertain Condition: <hi>If falſe,</hi> (vvhich is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known upon Examination) vve utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them. The reſt that belongs to this weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty matter Concerning Miracles you shall have, God vvilling, hereafter, part vvhereof is added to this Treatiſe. The remainder, I hope, vvill follow, before many Months come to an End.</p>

No. His ſtrange new mode in Arguing, moſt oppoſit to all cloſe reaſoning, is, bluntly and blindly to lay about him with huffs and Cavils, light where they will, he heed's not. For as much as concern's his <hi>tricks</hi> and <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> I will ſay in à word, they may (though far from being magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal) perhaps enſnare ſome vulgar people, who decry all that relishes Popery, but to shock the judgement of any prudent man, very few, for ought I know, have found their brains troubled with them. At leaſt hitherto, I never heard of one man, bred up in à right beliefe, gained to the Dr's opinions, by his Sophiſtry, tricks, or ſcribling books.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Now to prove what is here briefly hinted at, and to show the Dr's rash and <note place="margin">why the Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned this Anſwer</note> inconſiderate Anſwer, to be in real truth nothing like an Anſwer to my books, I have writ this short Treatiſe, where I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his ſhallowness in learning, and would, if poſſible, make him more wiſe, than vainly to boaſt of doing that which he neither has, not can perform He tell's us in his <hi>General Praeface,</hi> What an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

So little of the Spirit have I met with in theſe two diſcourſes of the Dr, that ſome may juſtly wonder, and perhaps miſlike my pains taken in following too exactly his pitiful Cavils, while they plainly ſe, that the very moſt which looks there like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance hath been refuted in my two laſt Treatiſes, and ſo penurious he is in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing any <hi>thing new against me</hi> in theſe his diſcourſes, that I could moſt eaſily, have replyed to all in one sheet of paper, but that would have gall'd Mr Dr and raiſed Clamours, as if I either could not, or would not anſwer him <hi>in his own way.</hi> To dead theſe falſe Alarms, I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to turn over much rubbish, to travel through the very moſt of his ſlight ſtuff, for want of better ſubſtance to work upon.</p>

In caſe my endeavour prove unſuccesful to the Dr, I doubt not, but that I shall unbeguile ſome over credulous People, whoſe opinion he courts, and would swell up with à high eſteem of his parts. <hi>Here lies his last aime.</hi> To do this, I shall by Gods grace evince, that He err's gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, in the main matters of Faith, want's learning, judgement, and common Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.

And I eaſily believe, that thoſe other worthy Authors the Doctor ſlights, and flurts at (all have their laſhes) well able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for them ſelves, will manifeſtly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke it out, that he only trifles, and ſpeaks
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93042:26"/> nothing to the purpoſe againſt their learned labours My endeavour is to anſwer for my ſelfe. Se more in the Preface to the Reader.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Doctor Still: in the page now cited pick's up à few of my Aſſertions taken out of the Book intituled. <hi>Proteſtancy wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout principles,</hi> and after his uſual manner, proceed's very diſingenuouſly; for he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mangles them as beſt ſerved his turn, or wilily ſtrip's them of all their proofs, which without any labour might have been added, and given vigour to every Propoſition. Finally he wholly waves the ultimate reaſon I alledge for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches infallibility, <hi>Proteſtancy without Princ:</hi> P. 28. where I prove; that Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is ruin'd, if for ought any man can know, all Churches, all Paſtors, and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des teach Chriſt's Doctrin ſo fallibly, that it may be falſe.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Now à word or two of my Aſſertions, related by the Dr. I ſay firſt. <hi>All true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> (not all men as the Dr miſcites) in the Aſſent given to Gods revealed veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are infallible, and prove the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. God the firſt Verity reveal's infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly eternal truths <hi>for this end,</hi> that all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him as <hi>he ſpeak's,</hi> if therefore he ſpeaks infallibly, all that believe him as he ſpeak's, believe infallibly.

                        <hi>Theſſa: 2. v. 12. Therefore we thank God wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout intermiſſion, becauſe when ye received the word of God which you heard from us, ye received it not as the word of men, but at it is indeed the word of God, who works in you that believe.</hi> Hence I infer'd.

Whoever diſown's ſuch infallible Believers ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſown's infallible Faith, and ſaid, this reaſon proves <hi>à ſubjective Infallibility</hi> in true Believers.

What harme in theſe Aſſertions? I challenge the Dr to ſpeak à probable word againſt them upon any known or owned Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, for hitherto he hath returned no Anſwer.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. I Aſſert. 2. P. 20. He that hear's an infallible Teacher hath the Spirit of truth, and he that hear's not an infallible Teacher wants the ſpirit of truth. Holy Scripture ſpeaks as I ſpeak <hi>Iohn. 1. c. 4. v.

In ſaying this, I wrong not in the leaſt Chriſts infallible Doctrin, but only aſſert, that à fallible or falſe delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which may eaſily deprave it, is not Chriſts infallible Doctrin, becauſe as yet it is not made ſufficiently Credible, nor ultimately applyed to à Hearer <hi>as Chriſt's Doctrin.</hi> An <hi>Arian,</hi> for example read's theſe words. <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> and ſo alſo doth Dr St. Both read the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Chriſt, yet contradict each other, and the one depraves and perverts it by his falſe and fallible delivery, I ſay this falſe and fallible teaching, moſt eaſily diſtinguish'd from revealed truths in Gods word, is not Chriſts infallible Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93042:35"/> Scripture, and yet more primarily upon Christ our Lord's teaching.</hi> Now as the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les often declared more fully what our great <hi>Maſter</hi> of truth infallibly delivered, and in this ſence explain'd and complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Doctrin, ſo alſo the Church of Chriſt in all Ages ſince, declared more amply what both Chriſt and the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les taught concerning the Myſteries of Faith, and in this ſence not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain's what they taught, but propoſes it alſo infallibly, as the certain Doctrin delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and upon this account is rightly <hi>called Conditio applicans,</hi> à neceſſary condition applying it to our capacities. Hence you ſe, though the ancient Truths were primarily matter of Faith, yet to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in ſucceeding Ages they ſtand, as it were, remote from all, and need this <hi>immediate Propoſal</hi> of the Church living, and actually teaching.</p>
                     <p n="21">21 The reaſon hereof, if you make à true Analyſis of Faith, is clear. For ask why I believe the Incarnation? I anſwer, the firſt Guides of the Church revealed it in Scripture, but enquire again, what aſſurance have I of that Revelation which is not <hi>exterminis evident,</hi> much leſs are all the particulars belonging to the Myſtery already laid forth, evident,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93042:36"/> I anſwer the Atteſtation of the preſent Church manifeſted by ſupernatural wonders gives me my laſt aſſurance, and <note place="margin">How the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents of Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Churches preſent Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des?</note> therefore either is à partial formal obiect of Faith, as I defend <hi>Reaſon and Religion, Disc. 3. c. 12. n.</hi> 8. 9. or at leaſt an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical neceſſary condition, as ſhall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward declared. Thus you <hi>ſe</hi> how, and in what manner, the beliefe of the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the firſt Proponents depend's on the rational Evidence, which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Guides of the Church give of thoſe firſt <hi>Proponents Infallibility.</hi> The verity of the Myſtery atteſted and conſidered in it ſelfe, depend's not upon the preſent Guides, for it was true before they taught, but à farther and more exact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of it, not diſcoverable before the Church ſpeak's, and the immediate application of it reſpectively made to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, depend's on theſe now living Guides. And this alſo the Dr muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, when by his preaching he <hi>truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes</hi> the high myſteries of Faith to the underſtanding of his Hearers.</p>
                     <p n="22">22 The Dr takes not his meaſures right in what followes. If men ſaith he, cannot be infallible in believing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles unless there be other infallible Proponents in every Age, to aſſure them that the Apoſtles were inſpired, why
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93042:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> muſt not the Infallibility of theſe preſent Proponents be likewiſe ſo atteſted as well as the Apoſtles? He would, I think, ask in clearer terms, Why ſhould not the Infallibility whereunto the now living Guides of the Church lay claim, be as well atteſted and applyed by another Infallible Atteſtation as the Church at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt's or applyes to us the Infallibility of the Apoſtles? And thus (as he inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes) we muſt goe on endleſly in theſe <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> and <hi>Atteſtations;</hi> or at laſt reſt in that firſt Atteſtation or application made by the Apoſtles.

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1 IT is prodigiouſly ſtrange to ſe how uniuſtly we Catholicks are dealt with, who, before theſe rambling Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts began their new whimſy of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and deſerted the old way of Truth, <hi>ſtood</hi> in à peaceable poſſeſſion of this great <hi>Verity. The Roman Catholick Church was, is, and ever shall be Infallible</hi> in what She clearly obliges her children to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. We then produced, and yet <note place="margin">Catholicks highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured</note> alledge as plain Scripture for the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ever God inſpired the firſt great Maſters of the Goſpel to write. We here publickly avouch, and will make it good, That God's word is as expreſs and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant in behalfe of the Churches Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, as for the moſt primary and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Articles of Chriſtian Religion. We confirm our Aſſertion by the unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93042:39"/> Authority of ancient Fathers, and learned Councils, we add here unto the Authority of à Church never yet cenſured by any but known Hereticks. Upon theſe grounds we ſtand. Now hear I beſeech you, how we are treated. There is à young hot Antagoniſt nam'd <hi>Dr Still:</hi> who call's this claim to Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. <hi>Page. 84. an uniuſt uſurpation,</hi> à thing <hi>notoriouſly falſe, an arrogant pretence of an uſurping faction</hi> &amp;c. Is it not, think ye, <note place="margin">The Dr called to an account.</note> high time after ſuch ratling language, to give this Bragger à juſt challenge, to call him to à rigid account before God and the world, and force him to prove what he ſaith? Scripture, Councils, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers without gloſſes ſhall ſpeak for us, theſe ſhall determine the cauſe, and end it. My evidences are as ſtrong, as known. 1. <hi>Tim. 3. 16. That thou mais't know how thou oughs't to converſe in the houſe of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of truth.</hi> Matth. 2. 8. 20. <hi>Goe therefore teach all nations, Teaching them to obſerve all things what ever I have commanded you, and behold I am with you all dayes to the end of the world.</hi> What Chriſt here promiſes, is certainly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, therefore his Protection over the Church will never fail. <hi>Iohn. 14. 15. I will pray the Father and he will give you another
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93042:40"/> comforter that may abide with you for ever, The Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive.</hi> The ſpirit of truth abiding with that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Chriſtians it's promiſed to, is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit to errour and falſhood. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. We read of <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets Euangelists,</hi> of <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Doctors,</hi> given by God's ſpecial Providence to the <hi>conſummation of Saints, unto the work of the</hi> Miniſtery, unto the <hi>edifying of the body of Chriſt</hi> &amp;c. If you ask how long this incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">Scripture plain for the Churches Infallibility</note> bleſſing ſhal laſt? It's anſwered. <hi>v,</hi> 13. until we all meet in the unity of faith, and knowledge of the Son of God, Demand again, for what end thoſe Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des are? <hi>verſe.</hi> 14, return's this Anſwer. <hi>That we be not like Children wavering, toſſed to and fro, or carried about with every wind of doctrin by the deceipt of men</hi> &amp;c. But if thoſe Guides can be circumvented with errour, how is it poſſible to ſecure Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians committed to their charge from being carried away with the wind of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Doctrin? No Catholick, though he ſtudy for it, can ſpeak more ſignificantly the Churches ſence concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of her Guides, then the bleſſed Apoſtle here amply expreſſeth. Thus much briefly for an Eſſay of Scriptural proofs. Fathers and Councils ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on à fitter occaſion, when the Dr requires them.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:93042:40"/>2 In the mean while, this Dr who makes the Church and all her Guides fallible (for her Infallibility, ſaith he, is à thing notoriouſly falſe) is called on to confront theſe Authorities, and to prove his own Aſſertion by plain and expreſs Scripture, or by ſo much as one <hi>Text</hi> that meanly and remotely hints at the fallibility of this great extended Body. Where, Sr, read we in holy <hi>Writ</hi> any thing tending to your ſence, <hi>That the Church is not the pillar and ground of truth?</hi> Where have we, that God who promiſed to be with the Church to the end of the world, would deſert Her in one Age or other? Where; That the Spirit of <note place="margin">Not one word in Scripture to prove her fallible.</note> truth ſhould leave this Oracle? Where find we (o horrid blaſphemy) that all Her <hi>Guides,</hi> all the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Doctors</hi> gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly deceived themſelves, may ſuffer mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of ſouls under their charge to be carried away with à whole deluge of errour, and one no leſſe <hi>then profeſſed Idolatry?</hi> Speake out Dr and produce your Scriptures, as plain for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches fallibility, as mine now alledged are for Her Infallibility.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Hence I argue. If the Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church be à notorious falſhood, or as the Dr makes it in his <hi>Account. P. 101 ridiculous,</hi> yea <hi>really diſtructive to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:93042:41"/> Her Fallibility is à Notorious truth which mainly ſupports true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. <note place="margin">An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> But God certainly hath not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to regiſter in holy <hi>VVrit</hi> à truth ſo notorious, as mainly ſupport's true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, therefore he hath not omitted to ſet down in plain Terms the Churches Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility. But this moſt evidently is not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, wherefore I tell the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> that not only he, but all the Doctors on earth, ſhall ſooner loſe their eyes, then find one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Text in the whole Bible which ſo much as ſeemingly makes the Church fallible, in what the obliges Chriſtians to believe. But if this cannot be evinced by Scripture (laid as à foundation to the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> diſcourſe) he may better goe to bed and ſleep, than meddle any more with the <hi>Queſtion of Infallibility,</hi> For all he ſaies or can ſay upon the Matter, will be meer empty talk, without proof and Principles.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 I urge this Argument further, and ask. Whether to believe the fallibility of the Church be à fundamental Article of the Dr's new Faith, or only one of his Inferiour truths which Scripture expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not, nor requires beliefe of, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation? Grant the firſt. He is obliged to prove it by God's expreſs word, for as he thinks all fundamentals
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93042:41"/> are there. Make. 2. this aſſerted <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi> to be only one of his Inferiour truths wholly waved by Scripture, and not neceſſary to Salvation, the Dr ſpoil's his own Scriptureleſs cauſe. With what face then dare he tell us in his <hi>Account</hi> cited above, that our pretence to Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility <hi>overthrowes belief, destroyes Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and tend's apace towards Atheiſm.</hi> Whilſt God never yet ſpake any ſuch unheard Aſſertions, Never Church taught them, Never Fathers owned them, Never Councils defined them; only the diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red phanſy of à young D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> begot them in Ignorance, and malice, as you ſe, hath ſet all forth in print. If I ſpeak raſhly, the Dr hath all liberty to ſhame me, and one ſingle paſſage in God's word where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this fallibility is proved, ſhall lay an eternal diſgrace upon me, but as I am ſure there is no ſuch paſſage, ſo I fear not any the leaſt diſgrace.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 What no ſuch paſſage may one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply? Surely I miſtake. For doth not Mr Still. in his <hi>Account. Part. 1. c.</hi> 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now all the Dr doth or can doe by way of Anſwer to theſe paſſages, is after his wonted faſhion, to gloſs them, as you may ſe in his <hi>Account</hi> P. chiefly 254. And cannot an Arian as nimbly gloſs the ſtrongeſt Text allegable for the Incarnation? (For example). <hi>I and my Father are one)</hi> as the Dr gloſſes this Text. <hi>I am with you alwaies</hi> &amp;c. I yeild ſaith the Biſhop cited in that page à continual Aſſiſtance granted the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors in Chriſts promiſes, <hi>but in à different degree. For it was of continual and Infallible Aſsistance to the Apoſtles, but to their Succeſſors of Continual and fitting Aſſiſtance, yet not Infallible.</hi> Mark the gloſs, (no Scripture God knowes) and note like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, how the Arian keep's him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. I grant, ſaith he, à unity or <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> between the Father and Son not in nature or Eſſence but in love <hi>and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> only, and that's à fitting unity, the other in nature appear's unbeſeeming God, yea Impoſſible.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Thus you have two fallible Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers <hi>Dr: Stil:</hi> and <hi>Dr Arian,</hi> delivering

That fitting Aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce maintained by you; Mr Dr; which excludes infallible aſſiſtance, is no more Gods expreſs word, or the Doctrin of any Orthodox Church, than that fitting <hi>unity</hi> excluding à real unity, maintained by an Arian, is God's word or the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of any orthodox Church. Or if it be, produce your Scripture. What is it then? A conceited gloſs which ſtand's unprincipled by it ſelfe. Obſerve I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you. We enquire whether the Church be not proved Infallible by the plain ſence of Chriſts words now cited. <hi>I am with you alwaies to the end of the world.</hi> the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> and his Biſhop ſay no, becauſe Her aſſiſtance is à <hi>ſitting one</hi> but not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. Here is their laſt proof, and 'tis no more but their own weak Aſſertion, that gives all the ſtrength to the thing which ſhould be proved, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently nothing like Chriſts Doctrin that ever ſtand's firm upon undubitable Principles. Nay more. That whole blundering diſcourſe held on by the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:93042:43"/> in his Account. P. 255. amount's to thus much only, that now and then he hint's at ſomething which ſhould be proved, but never proves it. And were he only once faulty in this diſſatisfactory procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it might paſs, but I muſt ſay more to unbeguile thoſe who read the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, and make this great truth known to all Viz. That when he handles theſe matters of Faith, and either oppoſes our Catholick Tenets, or goes about to eſtabliſh his Proteſtancy, the beginning, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and end of his diſcourſe, are naked and deſtitute of proofs. Neither Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor Church Authority ſpeak in his behalfe, whence it is that Cavils, jeers, drollery and impertinent excurſions take up the greateſt room in his writings, gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes you have without end, but no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled Doctrin to gloſs for. How eaſy were it, had the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> any thing like à good cauſe in hand, to prove his gloſs of à <hi>fitting but fallible Aſsiſtance</hi> by Scripture, or Church Doctrin? But we need not feare, for I tell him when that's done, the Arian will advance his gloſs as farr, and altogether as wiſely, unhinge one prime Article of Chriſtian faith.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1 OUr Dr by what I read in this firſt Part, chiefly build's his whole Religion upon the ſufficiency of Scripture, eaſily underſtood in Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by à <hi>Faculty</hi> that every man hath of diſcerning of truth and falſhood, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he much cleaves to <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> and followes exactly the ſteps of Mr Chiling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth. Here and there he recurr's to Gods Grace and to other helps, but ſaies not plainly what thoſe helps are, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he, while his whole endeavour is to exclude the Church from being the Rule or ground of Faith.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In behalfe of Scripture he laies down this Propoſition. <hi>P. 99. Although we cannot argue againſt any particular way of Revelation from the neceſſary Attributes of God, yet ſuch à way of writing being made choice of by him, we may juſtly ſay, that it is repugnant to the nature of the deſigne and the Wiſdom and Goodnes of God, to give Infallible
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:93042:44"/> aſſiſtance to perſons in writing his will for the benefit of mankind, if theſe writings may not be underſtood by all perſons who ſincerely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to know the meaning of them in all ſuch things as are neceſſary for their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> From this Principle he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that if thoſe writings may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by all perſons, its needles to rely on any Church (whether fallible or infallible) for our inſtruction in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, becauſe Scripture alone wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout the Church is the <hi>Master-Teacher,</hi> and à faculty granted every man of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning truth and falſhood, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but hit right upon theſe neceſſaries, knowes them all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 This Principle learnedly refuted by the Ingenious Author of <hi>Errour-Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus't.</hi> P. 81. ſuppoſes what neither is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">Dr Still:rule of Faith proved no rule.</note> nor ever ſhall be made probable. Viz. That an infinit Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath made choiſe of à Bible only with this deſign, that his will be known in things neceſſary to ſalvation, which is no more but à vain Suppoſition: For if eternal Wiſdom beſides the <hi>means</hi> of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Scripture hath appointed another far eaſier, whereby his will may be known, and without which Scripture cannot be underſtood, it is only <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> and not <hi>proved,</hi> that every vulgar perſon,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93042:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> who relies on his private judgement, is ſecured from errour after à ſincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to find his faith of all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in Scripture alone. And this I ſhall evince againſt the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> by urging one Argument, propoſed in my Two laſt Treatiſes.</p>

                        </gap> Caſt your thoughts ſeriouſly upon thoſe vaſt multitudes who call themſelves Chriſtians, and obſerve how they ſtand divided or parted in Faith. Take theſe for example. The <hi>Arians, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titrinitarians,</hi> the <hi>Manicheans, Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> alſo. Moſt certainly all theſe together, neither believe nor defend the true Doctrin of Jeſus Chriſt, for they hold plain contradictions, and this not only in leſſer matters eſteemed by the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> unneceſſary to Salvation, but in the moſt primary Articles of Chriſtian Religion. Some deny Chriſt our Lord to be truly the high God, and Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial with his eternal Father. Others to be truly Man. Some ſpeak well of God's unity, but refuſe to own à Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of perſons. Others finally ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively yeild to theſe great Myſteries and hold them as undoubted revealed veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the beliefe whereof is neceſſary to Salvation, after à due Propoſal. Of ſuch Articles I profeſs to ſpeak, waveing at
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93042:45"/> preſent all others, if any be of lower con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and now propoſe my Argument.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Chriſt our Lord who delights in no mans perdition, but <hi>will's all to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of his revealed truths. 1. Tim.</hi> 2. 4. hath either pointed out à clear way, or given ſome obvious and certain means whereby theſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that hold contradictions in the very Neceſſaries for Salvation, may be brought to à unity in Faith? Or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, hath not left any ſuch eaſy way, or means. If not; Chriſt is à moſt uncharitable Saviour, who on the one ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de obliges us to believe the fundamental Neceſſaries, yet on the other, caſt's all even the moſt learned upon an impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ever finding them, for if the certain means whereby to find what we ſeek for, fails (as is now ſuppoſed) our enquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Neceſſaries, is meerly à loſt and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs labour.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Doctor Still: who tells us, that God is not wanting in Neceſſaries to the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of mankind, thinks, as you have heard, That Scripture pondered by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans diſcerning faculty, without any other infallible Guide, is the beſt Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, the cleareſt light, and chiefeſt means whereby all ſincere Endeavourers may eaſily attain the knowledge of theſe Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries. Firſt, the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> makes here too
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93042:46"/> much haſt, for he ſhould on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion have given in an exact Catalogue of his <hi>Neceſſaries,</hi> theſe being of ſo high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that if one be miſtaken, or left out of his catalogue which is abſolutely Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, Faith faulters, and Salvation depending on Neceſſary Faith, miſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries alſo. But our Dr was wiſe, and thought it beſt to ſculk in Generalities for fear of being caught. To be briefe, let us ſuppoſe the beliefe of the Incarnation, that is of Chriſts being really <hi>true God and true man,</hi> may be deſervedly called one of the grand Neceſſaries for Salvation. If the Dr boggle at this, I know well how to proceed with him. Thus much ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 My Argument goes on. The Learned <hi>Socinians,</hi> the learned <hi>Arians</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">My Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proved.</note> with others, read and ponder the ſame Scripture you read Mr Dr. They want no more the Faculty of diſcerning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Truth and falſhood then you. They pretend to have as much of Gods grace as you can pretend to, and are as loth to damn themſelves by maintaining a wilful errour againſt Scripture, as you. Yet this matter of fact is evident, That they plainly contradict you in the belief of Neceſſaries, and ſo doe other moſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned Chriſtians alſo. What redreſs
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93042:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> now? Where have we the means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Chriſt to make us all of one Faith in this one <hi>Neceſſary</hi> already Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified? Scripture you ſe abuſed, by you or the Arian breed's theſe diſſentions, though none yet knowes by your Rule who is in fault, and therefore can be no fitt means to end them, for the ſence of it in the matter now propoſed, is the only thing in controverſy. This ground fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, all ſincere endeavour to learn what that book teaches without more help, fail's alſo.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Becauſe the Drs Faith is as much unknown to me as his perſon, (by ſome hints I gueſs it to be à very odd one) I will preſs my Argument farther, and demand. Whether, if à learned Arian, after an exact peruſal of Scripture, makes this ſincere judgement by his diſcerning <hi>Faculty,</hi> that the high God head of Chriſt is neither revealed in that book nor wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy beliefe, he may boldly abiure Chriſt, <hi>God and man,</hi> and yet be ſaved? In like manner I ask, whether, à learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, if after à ſerious reading he judges that Chriſt is truly God and believes qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te contrary to the Arian, may be ſaved alſo? In caſe the Dr ſay, all theſe, though of à moſt oppoſite beliefe concerning Neceſſaries may attain Salvation (and I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93042:47"/> verily think his Principles carries him <note place="margin">A difficulty propoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries.</note> to that deſperate conceſſion) with what conſcience can he oblige Chriſtians under pain of damnation to believe Chriſts Godhead, as à revealed verity moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation? For in real truth it is not ſo, becauſe men profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity may be ſaved without that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and if Salvation may be had, though this <hi>Myſtery be with contempt rejected,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that nothing of Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin can be judged more Neceſſary, and ſo the Turks beliefe of one God, will be Faith enough to ſave all. I might here add more, and tell you, that the ancient Church moſt injuriouſly cenſured the Arians as Heretiques liable to damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon their denying Chriſt's God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, for that denyal, in the ſuppoſition made, is not damnable.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Perhaps the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> will ſay. Some only of theſe open Diſſenters who hold contradictions in Neceſſaries are in the right way to Salvation, but others not, becauſe his Rule is neglected, for ſome out of ſlothfulneſs or for want of God's grace, endeavour not ſincerely to know the Scriptures meaning in ſuch matters. If this be his reply, the difficulty propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed return's again as vigorouſly as ever. We therefore ask by what clear way or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93042:47"/> means (Chriſt moſt certainly hath affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded means) can à ſerious Seeker after Neceſſaries, diſcern between theſe ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re not erring Chriſtians, and thoſe others who err? Unleſs theſe be eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, unleſſe it be known to what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church thoſe firſt belong, under what Paſtors they live, what ſure Guides they rely on; And the ſecond miſled be likewiſe pointed out as perverſe and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent, an Enquirer after Neceſſaries may as well cloſe with the <hi>Arian</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as he believes, as ioyn with the moſt Orthodox <hi>Christian</hi> in the world. The reaſon hereof is evident, for to know only in à general way that ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have à right beliefe, and others not (while all of a different faith profeſs to believe right) can never bring any to this determinate iudgement. <hi>Theſe are the ſincere Believers, Thoſe others eaſily pointed out, are not.</hi> And without this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <note place="margin">None can know by the Drs rule who are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who not.</note> diſtinguiſhing knowledge, <hi>Neceſſaries</hi> wholly out of our reach, are (as if they were not) uſeles and unprofitable; An Inſtance will give more light.

But what, may one reply, can we infer becauſe ſome miſtake the ſence of Scripture, therefore all do ſo? No truly; but this Inference is good, if ſome miſtake and others not, its Neceſſary to have the miſtaken clearly diſtinguiſhed from the ſincere Believers, otherwiſe à See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker after truth, may as well become an Arian as à ſound orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. The Queſtion therefore is how, or by what means this ſevering the faithfull from the miſled, wholly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Salvation, may be exactly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne without erring?</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93042:55"/> Scripture, it may, I hope, more eaſily diſcover the open Profeſſors of theſe truths, or that Chriſtian Society where ſuch truths are taught. 3. Suppoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were writ for this end to teach all Neceſſaries, how can the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> prove, that the ſearch after them is committed to every private man's erring changeable Faculty?

                     <p n="5">5 If all this be not an unintelligible
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93042:56"/> jumbling, I never read any. Pray reflect, <hi>Men are infallible in believing ſuch things as are Neceſſary for Salvation,</hi> and yet are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in judging of theſe Neceſſaries. How can they infallibly believe Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and not infallibly judge of them by that very infallible aſſent they give to Neceſſaries? Again, They are infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in believing Neceſſaries, but not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in teaching others the Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to Salvation. What is this to ſay? Cannot men <hi>commiſsioned to inſtruct others,</hi> teach that infallibly which they believe infallibly? The Dr believes infallibly the high <hi>God head in Chriſt,</hi> cannot he open his mouth and convey infallibly this Truth to others capable of <hi>believing infallibly,</hi> were he lawfully ſent to Preach?</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Now if by thoſe obſcure Terms, <hi>What are Neceſſaries to Salvation,</hi> he only mean, that none can tell <hi>How many Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries are,</hi> he ſpeak's à truth in his own Principles, but nothing to the preſent purpoſe, for here we only enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Guides of God's Church, are not impowred to deliver infallibly ſo much <hi>as one particular Neceſſary which they believe infallibly?</hi> No, ſaith the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Scripture is ſo clear in Neceſſaries, that no man who ſincerely deſires to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:93042:56"/> know them, ſhall be deceived. I anſwer firſt. Were it ten times clearer, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity hinder's not theſe Guides from declaring infallibly what Scripture ſpeaks infallibly? The moſt that can be inferred from hence (were all true as its falſe) is, that the Churches Guides need not to declare any thing; but that their declaration therefore ceaſes to be infallible, ſhall never be probably made out. 1 Anſwer. 2. The D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> groſly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, for moſt evident experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that thouſands and thouſands cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſtians are deceived, who ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely deſire to know what is Neceſſary to Salvation. Is it not manifeſt, as I ſaid above, that the <hi>Arians, Pelagians</hi> &amp;c. Or the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> with his Partizans, run on in à falſe beliefe of Neceſſaries? This matter of fact ſuppoſed, the Queſtion propoſed above return's again. <hi>VVhat means hath Chriſt left whereby</hi> all may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know the deluded or erring Party? And this proves the Scripture obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, or not perſpicuous in all Neceſſaries, unleſſe the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> infuſes à clarity into it which no mans eyes ever yet ſaw but his own, and à few Sectaries with him. The next pretty whimſy is, that he knowes no reaſon for uſeing the Term <hi>Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> yet i'ft be applyed to Infallible Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93042:57"/> of <hi>Neceſſaries he aſſerts it in that ſence.</hi> Is not this right as it ſhould be? He has no reaſon for uſeing the Term, but great reaſon to uſe the thing ſignified by the term. Let this paſſe, the worſt is yet to come.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 The Guides of the Church, ſaith he, <hi>P.</hi> 141. Suppoſing the ſame ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſhall enioy the ſame Priviledge with Ruſticks: That is, they may believe Infallibly as Ruſticks doe, yet none can <hi>Teach Infallibly.</hi> Firſt, this Anſwers not my difficulty above, when I ask'd, if theſe Guides and the Illiterate under their charge ponder Scripture, and uſe all ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re endeavour to underſtand its meaning, yet mainly differ in the beliefe of Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, what remedy in ſuch à caſe? Is not our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> obliged to propoſe ſome fair eaſy means whereby theſe Guides and people may be united in one faith, or at leaſt to tell us, on which party (whether Paſtors or People) the blame lies, to the end all may avoid them? Scripture moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently makes not the blamable known, nor unit's all in one Faith. An infallible Church is rejected, the diſcerning Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of diſſenting men run's, as we ſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wayes. Therefore all may believe, as they Judge, whether true or falſe, or ſuſpend their beliefe untill D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Still: laies
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93042:57"/> down à better rule. To that other part, I ſay, the Guides of the Church can teach infallibly the Neceſſaries they believe (and I ſtill inſiſt upon Neceſſaries only) The reaſon is given already. To believe the <hi>Infallible Truth</hi> of à Divine Revelation expreſſing à Neceſſary, is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation; but this, neither Scripture it ſelfe, nor the diſcerning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of any fallible man can declare or make known; therefore the Guides of <note place="margin">The reaſon, why the Guides of the Church teach infallibly.</note> the Church impowred by Chriſt to inſtruct <hi>(qui vos audit me audit)</hi> are to declare the <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Infallible truth, and ſence of every Revelation,</hi> relating to Neceſſaries. Now further. If this declaration be ſo fallible that it may be falſe, neither Jewes nor Gentils nor Chriſtians, yet ſeeking after theſe main truths, can come to any acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcency. For what have they to lean upon in the leaſt degree, Satisfactory?

Or did they<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derive their Infallibility from the books they wrote? The true anſwer to theſe demands will be our Anſwer. The Church is as rationally proved an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Oracle by her Illuſtrious ſignes and wonders (and appointed by God to teach) as ever any Apoſtle was, this I hold clearly evinced in my laſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <hi>Diſc: 3. c. 15. n. 3. and c. 16. n.</hi> 5.

If therefore the only true and infallible Religion be manifeſtly diſcernable or made known by the luſtre of Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Motives from all falſe Sects, we have enough. For it is moſt evident that our ever marked and Signalized Catholick Religion, illuſtrated by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and approved by the publick judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the very beſt and moſt learned who have lived ſince the Creation of the world, is the undoubted true Religion, where we learn what Chriſt taught, and what Doctrin the Apoſtles preached.

Who can decide here but an Infallible Church? Do you not know. 2. That it is more then ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to draw either Iew or Heathen to believe theſe contradictious Doctrins as Divine or reaſonable, while neither you nor Arians can aſcertain any, that what either of you teach is from God, or à truth <hi>revealed by him?</hi> Who ought or can ſpeak here but the Church?

That the clearneſs of Church Doctrin (univerſally known to all, whether Orthodox or others) beget's faith more eaſily then Scripture, yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and unſenced?

The <hi>Neſtorians</hi> the <hi>Iacobits</hi> the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants)</hi> are all agreed, <hi>That there is no Neceſſary of living in ſubiection to the Guides of the Roman Church, but they are all under their own Guides, which they do not queſtion will direct them in the right way to Heaven.</hi>

Are theſe diſſenting Chriſtians to be liſted among ſuch as you call ſincere <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavourers,</hi> who cannot but know what is neceſſary to Salvation by the clearneſs of Scripture? If you affirm; none of them
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93042:68"/> err in Neceſſaries or the Fundamentals of Faith, and conſequently the <hi>Neſtorians, Eutychians,</hi> and <hi>Arians</hi> are in à ſafe way to Salvation. Would to God, Sr, you would once declare your ſelfe plainly, that we may hereafter know of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe you are in heart, of any, or none, or of <hi>one as bad as none?</hi> Now on the other ſide, if you number not theſe among your ſincere Seekers, but account them miſled and deceived, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe do you produce ſuch examples? Is it to tell us, becauſe their Number is great, you would have them therefore thought of greater eſteem, or more val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, then the Catholick Church, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof they were once members, and from which Church their firſt Guides (like you) ungraciouſly receded? This way of arguing will ruin Chriſtian Religion, for Heathens, Turks, Iewes, and Atheiſts are far ore numerous then theſe. O! ſay you. P. 143. Every man when come to years of underſtanding ſee's upon his own Judgement and reaſon, an Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Chriſtian Religion above Heathens Turks &amp;c. This, Sr, is my Anſwer. Every man at ſuch years, if he will open his eyes, cannot but ſe an incomparable greater luſtre and Excellency manifeſt in the Catholick Church, <hi>as Antiquity,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:93042:68"/> Converſions, Miracles,</hi> than in all thoſe other Societies, though called Chriſtians, who abandon'd it. It is true they ran out of this Church, but left behind them Gods own Signatures, Marks, and Signs of true Chriſtianity upon it ſtill, theſe they could never rob us of, nor appropriate to themſelves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (its Gods juſt judgement upon them) remain as they do, <hi>obſcure</hi> and <hi>contemptible.</hi> Perhaps the Dr intended by his inſtances to give ſome little coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to his Proteſtancy. If ſo, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. This Proteſtancy has the worſt luck of all other Sects in the world, its like another <hi>Iſmael,</hi> as it ſtand's up againſt all called Chriſtians, ſo all are againſt this Novelty, and diſcard it as Antichriſtian. Neither the <hi>Greeks, Abyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins,</hi> or <hi>Neſtorians</hi> can endure it, whereof ſome of them ſcarce hold it à Chriſtian Religion. Read Prince <hi>Radzivil</hi> in his <hi>Ieroſoly. Peregrin:</hi> Antwerp print. 1614. <hi>P.</hi> 109.

Now why ſuch men ſhould be courted, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented, or thought worthy to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance God's Church, is à riddle to every ſound Chriſtian. Yet more. There are evident contradictions main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained among <hi>Neſtorians, Iacobits, Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians, Grecians,</hi> and others, who pretend to believe Catholick verities. And here our difficulty propoſed above recurr's again, concerning the plain obvious means left by Chriſt to bring all theſe to one unity in faith, and this the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſhall never clear without liberty granted every one to believe what is fancied true, not what God has truly revealed.

Now we enter into his ſecond Diſcourſe.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>Doctor Stillingfleets pretended Anſwer to E: VVs: Two books, Proteſtancy without Principles, and Reaſon and Religion, shew'd no Anſwer, but à meer ſhuffling, or palpable digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the main point handled in thoſe Treatiſes. How the Dr ſhift's off the only difficulty, wherein ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is required?</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1 THere are, as I conceive, two wayes of anſwering à book. The one to follow an Adverſary ſtep by ſtep, the other to reverſe his Principles, or at leaſt to ſolve ſuch Arguments as the Author judges worth an Anſwer. If he judge amiſs, or thinks weak argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſtrong ones, à Reſpondent ought fairly to lay forth their want of ſtrength, and ſhew wherein they are fallacious. The thing I chiefly aimed at in both Treatiſes was, as thoſe know who read them, to vindicate the Infallibility of the Roman Catholick Church from the unjuſt cenſure of Sectaries, whether you take it as à large body ſpread the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93042:71"/> whole world over, or conſider its Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative in general approved Councils. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stilling: as appear's by his Title undertakes to anſwer theſe books, but doth it after à new mode, or the ſtrangeſt way I ever yet ſaw in any. He waves all my Arguments, which I judge, prove clearly the Churches <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and entertain's himſelfe with ſome few <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters,</hi> little or nothing relating to this main difficulty.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 You will perhaps better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand my meaning, if I briefly ſum up <note place="margin">The chiefe Contents in the Drs ſecond Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, briefly Collected,</note> the chief contents of this Doctors idlely ſpent labour, in the ſecond diſcourſe from his 2. Chapter page 329 to page 433. Thus it is. Firſt he enters into à ſerious matter with meer Drollery, and ſpiteful language. 2. He tranſcrib's ſome parcels of my Doctrin mangled, as he thought beſt for his own deſign, and leaves all as he found it, though here and there he featly intermingles ſome ſcoffes, thought by him pretty <hi>lests,</hi> and to make greater confuſion, now you find him like à rat nibbling at one of my Treatiſes, now at the other, without method or order, and the whole ſtrain of his writing is either to tell the Reader, what he ſaies without the leaſt ſhadow of proof, which directly makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Churches Infallibility,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93042:72"/> or barely to relate what I aſſert for it, but replyes not at all to the Arguments I chiefly inſiſt upon, as will preſently appear. It is true, about his page. 362 he would fain batter my Anſwers to two Objections taken out of his <hi>Account,</hi> which meerly touch upon à Scholaſtical point. (How weakly we ſhall ſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) but all this while not à word co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes from him, which directly tend's to prove the Church fallible, nor can I find any of my Arguments ſolved. Yet this is the man, that in his Title-page pretend's to Anſwer my two books. 3. After ſome quarrels with the Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turality of Faith, and its obſcure tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, He ſlip's aſide into another Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical point, concerning the Reſolution of Faith, and becauſe the matter of it ſelfe is hard (and made harder by his jumbling) he get's into à Labyrinth of his own making, called the <hi>Rational Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Christian Religion.</hi> My chief endeavour ſhall be to wind him out of it, which would ſoon be done, were he better verſed in ſpeculative learning.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> as I ſaid now, ſome what waſpiſh, layes aſide much of his gravity, and begins with, <hi>Ironies, Mockeries,</hi> and <hi>bitter language,</hi> called by ſome <hi>Ieſt earnest,</hi> and diſcharges that rounder ſhot of <hi>Toyes,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:93042:72"/> Triffles,</hi> and <hi>Fancies,</hi> very thick upon me. Is not this hard proceeding? Methinks theſe men of the new Goſpel are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely priviledged to reproach, when the <note place="margin">Of the Dr's Ironies and bitter Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</note> ſpirit moves. What à gallant leſſon had he learn't us in the. 5. Page of his Preface to the former book: <hi>Not to revile though he be reviled,</hi> and here, weak man, he breaks his purpoſe, forget's his leſſon and reproaches boldly? And will you know why? Forſooth, he takes it ill that I joyned him in my Title-page with <hi>Atheiſts, Iewes, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Sectaries.</hi> In real earneſt, Mr D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, though I ſaid it not in plain terms, yet I thought you well deſerved the place, but ſeing you reſent my putting you after that rabble, you ſhall in my next book be upermoſt, and have à palce before them all. But in God's name what unluckie Spirit light on you in that deep Exclamation? <hi>O! what à peſtilent Heretick is this Stillingfleet.</hi> Look to it Doctor. <hi>Ridentem dicere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum quid vetat?</hi> If you in raillery make your ſelfe heretick, and others judge you one of the worſer ſort I will pray for you, but can not clear you of the guilt before you deſerve better. There is more of this rambling. He tell's me. If either of my books were thrown at his head, he would have enough to defend himſelf,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93042:73"/> for they are very thick and heavy; But how would he defend that precious Pate, were his voluminous <hi>Account</hi> thrown after them? I am ſure that's thicker, and heavier. <hi>To my great comfort, ſaith he, I never yet ſaw two ſuch bulky books, whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance might be brought into à leſs compaſs, or more full of Tautologies, and tedious repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> A homely complement. I hope, Sr. you except your own bulkie <hi>Account,</hi> or ought in all reaſon to do ſo, for in my whole life I never read any thing more ſtuff't with empty words, and ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding Tautologies. To be ſhort, I dare wager ten to one, if ever you and I meet in Holborn, that for one Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie in mine, I will ſhew five in yours, with à pretty addition of new ones in theſe your two laſt Treatiſes. Now whereas you tell me, the whole ſubſtance of my books lies in this one word, <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> Know, Sr, you get the worſt here, for the whole ſubſtance of all you have ſaid, or <hi>can</hi> ſay, confeſſedly lies in à far weaker word called, <hi>Fallibility.</hi> Here it ſeem's, the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> is willing to leave off his long Tattle, <hi>for fear of more Advertiſements.</hi> And is it poſſible, could that harmleſs and well meant <hi>Advertiſement</hi> wherein nothing can be found offenſive, ſtirr up thus much unruly paſſion in à D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>? I
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93042:73"/> know no remedy, yet hope the Preface to this Treatiſe, will à little calm it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 To end. He ierk's me once more, and will need's ſuppoſe that <hi>Proteſtancy without Principles</hi> was diſpoſed of to better uſes, than to be read, becauſe forſooth <hi>he</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">More jerks yet.</note> 
                        <hi>never heard of one man in England, that read it over.</hi> A weak proof of à falſe ſuppoſition. Good Sr, are all truths conveyed to your ears, do not ſome miſs their way thither? Be it how you will, <hi>hear,</hi> or <hi>pretend not to hear,</hi> moſt certainly that book was read by many, not only in England, but Ireland alſo. Nay more; all the Copies above ſix hundred (excepting ſome few ſeized on) were in à ſhort time bought up, In ſo much, that à Gentleman of our Nation, offered three Crowns for one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Copy, yet could not after long enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meet with one. Theſe truths known to the Printer and others, are ſufficient to evert your falſe ſuppoſition, and your weak proof added to it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 And thus much of the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Comical Introduction. If he thinks me too pert or pleaſant with him, I anſwer. <hi>Benedictis ſi certaſſet, audiſſet bene.</hi> Had not à fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">The Dr's vaſt conceipt of himſelfe.</note> of blood tranſported him beyond all bounds of common civility, no ill word ſhould have fallen from me, but when we find à vain Bragger gloriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown'd in à vaſt conceipt of himſelfe,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93042:74"/> as if all he treat's with, were deſplicable Muſhromes, it is Charity, I think, not to ſooth him up in his folly, but to tell him his own home, as S. Hierome once did an Adverſary. <hi>Quae voluisti locutus, quae non vis audire debes.</hi> Time I hope may make the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> wiſer. Let us now goe on.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 I ſaid above Dr Still: anſwers not directly one Argument propoſed by me for the Churches Infallibility. If I prove the Aſſertion it followes clearly, that either he underſtand's them and <hi>will</hi> not anſwer, becauſe he finds them too ſtrong for him: Or, 2, he cannot anſwer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he penetrat's not their force. Grant the firſt, he is à meer cheat, and deludes the Reader with à ſeeming reply, which is none in ſubſtance. Say. 2. He underſtand's not the force of my Arguments, and cannot anſwer, he is unworthy to be dealt with, and ought in that meaſure to be deſpiſed, as he deſpiſes others.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 Now I prove my Aſſertion. I ſay as he relates, P. 331. That without an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible <note place="margin">The Dr an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers net my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> Church (he means in this preſent ſtate as I often inculcate) there can be no certainty of Faith, and have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the Aſſertion upon theſe grounds. Neither the <hi>Canon,</hi> nor <hi>Divinity, nor the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93042:74"/> Infallible truth, or ſence of Scripture,</hi> even in points <hi>Neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, much leſs certainly aſſured to any in this preſent ſtate, but by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of an Infallible Church. To this <hi>not à word</hi> of anſwer is, or can be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 I Aſſert. 2. As the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> cites, that the Roman Catholick Church only is God's Infallible Oracle, and prove it, <hi>Reaſ. and Relig: D. 2. c. 14. n.</hi> 10. 11. from Scripture, Fathers, and moſt preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant reaſon. 1. If any Church be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible it is the Roman Catholick, for all others diſclaim the Guidance of an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible living Oracle. 2. As nothing can more diſcountenance the worth of true Chriſtianity, than à ſtedfaſt perſwaſion of it's <hi>fallibility,</hi> or eaſily being falſe; So nothing can fix in us an undubitable beliefe of Chriſt's Doctrin, but an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle not lyable to errour. 3. And chiefly, If no Church be Infallible to whoſe Authority Chriſtians muſt ſubmit, when diſſentions ariſe concerning the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals <note place="margin">Proofs for the Churches Infallibility.</note> of Faith, and the genuin ſence of Scripture, both <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> may moſt juſtly deſpiſe Chriſtian Religion, and ſcorn all our endeavours to make them of one Faith with us, upon this ground, That none can certainly ſay,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93042:75"/> what Doctrin Chriſt our Lord or his Apoſtles taught the world. So it is, Mr D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, our debates about the prime Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith (no ſatisfactory means to end them, but Topicks and fallible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning) are ſo many, that all taught Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin lies like an undecided <hi>Proceſs</hi> in law ſtill diſputable, and therefore of no credit or eſtimation, unleſs an Infallible Church decide them, and bring Chriſtians to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in one Faith. Theſe Arguments and many more I propoſed againſt the Doctor in the Diſcourſe now cited, and all the Anſwer I have, is, that he ſet's down ſome mangled parcels of my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, or barely tells me what I ſay. For example. I aſſert, <hi>Proteſtancy without Prine: Diſc. 1. c.</hi> 2. That à Doctrin which by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue <hi>of all the Principles it has, is meerly falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and no more, may be falſe, but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrin (ſay Sectaries) as it <hi>is taught by all Paſtors is thus fallible,</hi> therefore it may be falſe: But God never Sent Chriſt our Lord, nor Chriſt his Apoſtles, or any, to teach Chriſtian Doctrin that may be falſe, <hi>Ergo</hi> he ſent none to teach meer fallible Doctrin. This Reaſon our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> blindly hints at. P. 333. but leaves it without any Anſwer. And thus he run's on to his 339. <hi>P.</hi> where he tells me. <hi>He hath laid together ſo many parcels of my rambling

It was my duty and <hi>pertinent,</hi> when I undertook the full and adequate Reſolution of Divine Faith, to lay down all the Principles it relies on, and à main one, is the internal aſſiſtance of Grace.

                     <p n="9">9 From P. 340. to 362. the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> gives me but little entertainment, ſave only to make à few reflections upon his too many Parergons, and one repeated over and over (yet the good man will be free from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:93042:76"/> Tautologies) is, that the difficulty now in hand only concern's an external Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, ſuch as the Church is. Shall we condeſcend to his humour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate that ſole Queſtion? I am content upon one condition, that he plainly ſolves this plain difficulty. If all the men in the world (as we now ſuppoſe) conſidered meerly as nature has framed them be fallible; If none of them have infallible aſſiſtance to teach the very fundamentals of faith infallibly, and, if notwithſtanding God obliges all to believe his infallible revealed verities without mixture of errour; If finally, we evidently ſe Chriſtians at high Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and of à different belief in ſuch Neceſſaries, of no leſs concern then their eternal Salvation. I ſay, if all theſe <note place="margin">And leaves all to believe what they liſt.</note> particulars be undeniably manifeſt, either you, Mr D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ought to aſſign ſome clear certain means whereby Chriſtians may be brought to union in one true Faith, to profeſs and believe one and the ſame Doctrin of Jeſus Chriſt, or you muſt leave all to believe as they liſt, or what pure fancy teaches. My Tenet is that none can doe this <hi>but an Infallible Church,</hi> nor ſo much as bring us to any <hi>Vnity</hi> at all, were faith, as you make it, only morally certain.</p>

He wrong's me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. <hi>Se Reas and Relig. Diſc. 2. c.</hi> 15. There I prove at large, that Divine Faith in this preſent ſtate requires no leſs an Infallible Oracle, then the belief of the Primitive Chriſtians required In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in the Apoſtles. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſupernatural Principles of thoſe firſt Believers never could operate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Doctrin taught Infallibly by the Apoſtles, ſo they work not in true Believers now, but when they fall right upon the Infallible Doctrin taught by the Catholick Church. The reaſon hereof is clear. God cannot concurr or incite any by Supernatural Principles to believe a falſhood, The Revelation therefore which ſupport's Divine Faith, muſt not be meerly <hi>apparent,</hi> but real and truly in being, for then only Divine Grace cooperat's with Faith, not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. So true it is, that the Infallibility in our internal Aſſent of Faith, ever ſuppoſes and neceſſarily prerequires In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in the laſt ground thereof, which is God's veracity, as likewiſe in the immediate Proponent, I mean the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93042:77"/> Catholick Church. But ſaies our Dr very wiſely. <hi>If the Infallible certainty of Faith depend's upon Divine concurrence, the Infallibility of Faith may be had without an Infallible Proponent.</hi> A moſt pitiful reply. It ſeem's he cannot well underſtand how one act of Faith depend's upon two diſtinct Principles, yet the inſtance now given will enlighten him à little. Did not the Faith of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians depend upon the Apoſtles infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">The neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry principles for Faith</note> teaching? None queſtions that. And had not Divine grace influence upon it alſo? Moſt undoubtedly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. <hi>Ergo</hi> two different Principles, an Infallible Church and Divine Aſſiſtance neceſſarily ſupport one act of Faith. The reaſon is clear. Faith is the Gift of God and therefore without the coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Grace cannot be Divine or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, and without an Infallible Proponent no man certainly knowes what to believe. For who can ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitably this is the ſence of God's word, herein lies the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> of à Revelation, if an Infallible Church be rejected? Hence it is that the Primitive Church while She condemned all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hereticks, and eſtabliſhed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary truths, never proceeded <hi>doubtfully,</hi> or <hi>probably,</hi> but ſpake as Gods Oracle

Should I, Sr, maintain à light of Faith allowed men at random, to believe what their private judgements tell them concerning Gods revelations in Scripture, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of <hi>all Infallible exteriour Propounders of Faith,</hi> I ſhould not much differ from Calvin, but when I only aſſert it to ſerve for à better manifeſtation <hi>of ſuch truths as an Infallible Church delivers,</hi> which are known without that light, <hi>though by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour degree of certainty,</hi> the Calviniſm is more in your head, then in my Doctrin.

                     <p n="13">13 P. 347, to P. 361. I find the like bundle of traſh all along. Now moral certainty refuted above comes in again.

That as the primitive Chriſtians reſolved their Faith, juſt ſo we reſolve ours, and argue thus. Had one demanded of thoſe firſt converted multitudes after the Canon of Scripture was written, why they believed Chriſt to be the Son of God and Saviour of the world? They might have anſwered, Scripture, as we are taught, expreſſes theſe verities. But ask again, how know you, that your Scriptures are not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitious <note place="margin">We now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve our Faith, as the primiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians did before us,</note> as ſome Goſpels have been? They would have ſaid (for we ſuppoſe them reaſonable) this we believe upon the undoubted Teſtimony of thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed men the Apoſtles who wrot that Holy book. Yet another Queſtion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues. How do you know that theſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93042:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> Apoſtles were not Cheats, for there have been falſe Prophets and Apoſtles, but men inſpired by Almighty God to teach and write his ſacred verities? Had they proved this by Scripture the Circle would have been inevitable. For to ſay <hi>Scripture is Gods word becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles tell us ſo, and to ſay the Apostles were infallible Oracles of truth, becauſe the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re affirm's that, implies à moſt vicious circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi> Their rational Anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would have been, for there is no other. The manifeſt wonders done by the Apoſtles, their ſtrange Miracles and Converſions wrought the whole world over, their eminent Sanctity and ſheding of blood for the Doctrin delivered by them, proved thoſe bleſſed men to be Oracle divinely inſpired, Gods moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Commiſſioned Teachers. But all this Diſcourſe hold's exactly, applyed to the Roman Catholick Church, for She evidences the like undeniable Miracles, greater Converſions, more martyrdoms ſince the Apoſtles dayes, moſt admirable Sanctity in thouſands and thouſands, therefore She in like manner is proved God's Oracle, as is more largely declared in the place now cited.</p>
                     <p n="17">17 This Argument I urged againſt the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, and told him <hi>c.</hi> 6. that he was either obliged to ſhew wherein thoſe

Chap:</hi> of that. 3. Diſcourſe. You ſay firſt. This way of reſolving Faith ſeem's vnreaſonable, becauſe an aſſent is <hi>hereby required beyond all degree of Evidence,</hi> no grounds being aſſign'd for it, but the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93042:82"/> motives of Credibility which are fallible. Here are three <hi>errours at once,</hi> plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed in the Chapters now cited, where I ſay, our true Chriſtian Faith in this preſent ſtate no more goes beyond the proportion and degree of evidence (be yet this unexplicated evidence what you will) then the Faith of the Primitive Chriſtians went beyond it. And I urg'd you again and again to giue à diſparity, or to ſhew wherein the tendency of their Faith was different from ours. 2. It is à flat calumny to ſay as you do, that, I aſſigne no other grounds for Faith but the motives of Credibility, which you ſuppoſe faillible. <hi>C. 2. n.</hi> 8. I ſay expreſly, our Aſſent to matters of Faith is ultimatly grounded upon God's Divine Teſtimony, and not <hi>(as Faith)</hi> upon the motives, which induce to believe, and there parified the ground of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians Faith with the ground we rely on, and their Motives with ours. For example. Some of them ſaw, others heard of the Apoſtles ſtrange Miracles, admirable Sanctity &amp;c. and thence ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally inferred that they were men ſent from God and believed their Doctrin, though hard and difficult, upon their <hi>infallible words.</hi> Thus I diſcourſe as to the Church, and wiſh the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, would ſhew
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93042:82"/> where I miss, or give any ſhadow of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. 3. If the motives of credibility have à certain and infallible connexion with the Divine Revelation, which I grant, The Dr's ſuppoſition of fallible or probable motives in this place is wholly impertinent, and makes nothing againſt my <hi>Analyſis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19 Still he rambles on and knowes not, I think, what he would be at. <hi>It is not ſufficient</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to ſay, that the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Churches Teſtimony makes the Aſſent infallible, for the Aſſent is not according to the objectiue certitude of things, but the Evidence of them to our underſtanding.</hi> Of what objective certitude or evidence <hi>of things</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">An obiective certitude ſpoken of, not expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by this Dr.</note> can this man ſpeak, think ye?

Or dare he aſſert that the <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Infallible Divine Inſpiration, and true ſenſe of Scripture</hi> appear evidently to our underſtanding; While we ſe innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable called Chriſtians at implacable variance about theſe matters? Vnless this be maintain'd, wholly improbable, the evidence here mentioned concerning no man yet knowes <hi>what things,</hi> is plain Nonſence. Again what evidence hath the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of theſe ignote <hi>Things,</hi> who gives no greater certitude to any Aſſent but à
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93042:83"/> moral one, which may be falſe? Yet he run's on. <hi>Suppoſing the Teſtimony of the Roman Church to be really infallible yet ſince the means of believing it are but probable and prudential, the aſſent cannot be according to the nature of the Teſtimony conſidered in it ſelf, but according to the reaſons which induce me to believe ſuch à Teſtimony infallible.</hi> By the <hi>means</hi> here pointed at the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> underſtand's the motive of credibility only, and therein err's, for we ſhall ſhew hereafter other means. But had we none, who tells him that the Motives are only probable, or barely prudential? I ſay they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and eſſentialy connected with the Divine Revelation, though were they only moral, the certitude of Faith is yet defenſible, as will appear in the next Chapter. 2. If the Churches Teſtimony conſidered <hi>in it ſelf</hi> be infallible, as he ſuppoſes, it cannot but be known as it is <hi>infallible,</hi> for no man will ſay, that God founded an <hi>infallible</hi> Church with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to hide or remove from our ſight her infallible Teſtimony, <hi>whoſe final end is to teach all infallibly.</hi> Therefore providence hath left certain means, whereby the learned may come to the knowledge of that neceſſary truth. I have ſpent three whole Chapters in the third Diſcourſe upon this ſubject, yet the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93042:83"/> Dr replyes not to one of my Arguments. 3. What ever he urges here concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the means of believing, upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable inducements (and it is all raked out of his Account) I have not only anſwered in my laſt Treatiſe, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted alſo, as you may ſe. <hi>Diſc. 3. c. 2. n.</hi> 5. 6. 7</p>

                     <p n="21">21 Hereupon enſues à troubleſome difficulty. This humane fallible Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, this Conſent, and all other Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves previous to the belief of the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

This and more I have in the place now cited, but the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>'s courage fail'd to return an Anſwer. Perhaps he will tell me, his belief of the Incarnation goes not beyond the uncertain lights of his fallible motives. Grant this, and it followes evidently. 1. That he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict's himſelf, as will be proved in the next Chapter. It followes. 2. That his Faith of this <hi>fundamental Myſtery,</hi> for ought any man living can know, may be à Lye. 3. That all Chriſt's Doctrin as it is now believed by Faith, may be both fallible and falſe. 4. That God obliges the whole Chriſtian world to believe that, as an infallible truth, which really may be à falſhood. Laſtly, that all the glorious Martyrs in forgoing Ages, were bound to maintain that with the loſſe of their lives, <hi>to be à truth;</hi> which
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93042:84"/> only apparently was ſo, and might in reallity be no truth. If the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſubſcrib's to theſe conſequences, he has not one drachm of true Faith in his heart. Now one word more with the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                        <p>Dr Still: grant's that Faith tranſcend's the certainty of thoſe Motives which induce to believe. Independently of his Conceſsion, that verity is proved, and the ground thereof firmly ſetled. How neceſſary it is to diſtinguiſh between the Credibility of à Myſtery, and the infallible believing it true. Obiections anſwered. Other difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties propoſed.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1 Dr Still: in his Account. Part. 1. c. 7. P. 207. Speak's thus. <hi>Moral certainty yeilds ſufficient aſſurance, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is infallibly true,</hi> and he proves the Aſſertion, <hi>becauſe moral certainty may evidently shew us the Credibility of Chriſtian Religion, and that from the credibility of it, the infallible truth of it may be proved, will appear by theſe two things. 1. That where there is evident Credibility in the matter propounded,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93042:85"/> there doth ariſe upon men an obligation to believe: And that is proved...... from</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">What the Dr teaches.</note> 
                        <hi>Gods intention in giving ſuch Motives, which was to perſwade them to believe, as appears by multitudes of places of Scripture; and withall, though the meer credibility of the Motives might at firſt ſuppoſe ſome doubts concerning the Infallibility of the Doctrin, yet it is not conſiſtent with any doubt as to the obligation to believe, becauſe there can be no other reaſon aſſigned of thoſe Motives of credibility, than the induceing on men an obligation to Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>That where there is ſuch an obligation to believe, we have the greateſt aſſurance that the matter to be believed is infallibly true: which depend's on this manifeſt proof, that God cannot oblige men to believe à lye, it being repugnant to all our conceptions of the veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Goodnes of God to Imagin that God should require of men (on the pain of eternal damnation) to believe ſomething infallibly true, which is really falſe.</hi> Thus the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Reflect courteous Reader. Is it ſo, <hi>that from the Credibility of Christian Religion, the Infallible truth of it may be proved?</hi> There is then no doubt at all, but if it be <note place="margin">Advantage given by the Dr's own Doctrin.</note> proved infallibly true, it may be alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved as it is, <hi>infallibly true.</hi> Doth the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> concede, that from the <hi>Evident Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility</hi> of Chriſtian Doctrin, <hi>there ariſes in all men an Obligation to believe it,</hi> and that
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93042:85"/> this obligation <hi>is not conſiſtent with any doubt, as to the obligation of believing it?</hi> I wiſh no more from an Adverſary, having enough to make good all I ſay concerning the Infallibility of Divine Faith. Doth he finally aſſert, that where there is ſuch an obligation we have the <hi>greateſt aſſurance,</hi> that the matter believed <hi>is infallibly true,</hi> becauſe God cannot require of men to believe that as infallibly true, which is really falſe? I wholly agree with him thus farr, yet withall affirm that he plainly contradict's his own Doctrin. For, if when there is ſuch an obligation to believe, we have the <hi>greateſt aſſurance (that is infallible aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or nothing)</hi> that the matter believed is infallible true, it is undiſputably clear, that Faith which has that <hi>greateſt aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi> goes far beyond the certainty of the Motives which is only moral, and not ſo infallible certain as the very act of Faith is. Hence it followes that the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> contradict's himſelf in all he teaches concerning the moral certainty of Faith, and muſt, while he hold's Faith infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly certain grant, that as terminated upon the truth of à Revelation, it riſes higher and goes beyond the ſtrength of the motives, which only afford moral certainty, and not greater. But of this more preſently.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:93042:86"/>2 In the mean time, I wiſh the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> would make what he ſaies here, to agree with ſome odd expreſſions in his prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent page 206. There we are told, <hi>that certainty implies the taking away all ſuſpicion of doubt, but in moral things all ſuſpicion of doubt is removed upon moral evidence,</hi> and here he ſaith. <hi>Though the meer Credibility of the Motives</hi> (only morally certain) <hi>might at firſt ſuppoſe ſome doubt concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Doctrin, yet it is not conſiſtent with any doubt, as to the obligation to believe.</hi> I Say contrary, if it may at firſt ſuppoſe ſome doubt, it muſt ever ſuppoſe it, for this moral certainty grounded on the <hi>Miracles internal to Scripture,</hi> as the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> teaches, growes not leſs nor more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive in time, but is alwaies the ſame, and therefore cannot remove all doubt from a Believers mind.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Hence I argue. This moral certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at firſt capable of doubt, comes in time to be infallible certainty, or ſtill retain's ſome doubt. In caſe it be improved, and grow up to <hi>infallible</hi> certainty, it yeilds not in certainty to the very act of Faith, where unto it perſwades, and ſo the Dr's diſtinction, between <hi>moral certainty,</hi> and <note place="margin">An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> his term's <hi>Infallibly true,</hi> becomes frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. <hi>Moral certainty,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>yeilds us ſufficient aſſurance that Chriſtian Religion, is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93042:86"/> infallibly true.</hi> Say now, that this moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is ſtill conſiſtent with ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of doubt, it muſt either derive that doubt into the very act of <hi>Faith,</hi> and make <hi>that doubtful,</hi> or it ought to be granted, that Faith riſes higher, and goes beyond the ſtrength of that moral doubtful cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, contrary to the Dr's Principles. I wiſh alſo he had explaind him ſelf better in this other dark Propoſition. <hi>Moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty may be as great as Mathematical and Phiſical, ſuppoſing as little reaſon to doubt in moral things as to their natures, as in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and Phiſical, as to theirs.</hi> Theſe words. <hi>Suppoſing as little reaſon to doubt,</hi> ſpoil all he ſaies, for if moral certainty ever ſuppoſes ſome ſuſpicion of doubt, how can that be as great as Mathematical or Phyſical, which ſuppoſes none? But enough of this jangling.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 We now come to the main point, and ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that, <hi>although the Motives were only Morally certain, and not (as I hold) infallibly connected with Divine Revelation,</hi> yet the act of Faith it ſelf, is infallibly certain, and conſequently riſes above that weaker light of the Motives. This I ſay to vindicate the abſolute infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of Faith from all iuſt exceptions, while Divines vary about the connexion of the Motives, with the Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="128" facs="tcp:93042:87"/>5 The proof of my Aſſertion ſtands firm upon two Principles laid down <hi>Prot. without Prin. Diſc. 1. C. 5. n. 6. 7. And Reaſ: and Relig. Diſc. 3. C. 8. n.</hi> 16. In the firſt place I ſay (and its à <hi>Maxim</hi> known by the light of nature) that God, who is Supereminently more infallible than all men and Angels are, ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved <hi>anſwerable to his Excellence,</hi> with à moſt firm aſſent. In the ſecond place I aſſert, though we have not Evidence of the Divine Teſtimony in it ſelf, yet when it is made <hi>evidently credible</hi> by clear Signs that God ſpeaks to us, and for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <note place="margin">By Faith we aſſent not to the bare credibility of à Myſtery.</note> we, as rational creatures, are obliged to ſubmit and believe him, becauſe <hi>he command's</hi> us to believe, and are thereupon bound to aſſent, not to the bare <hi>credibility</hi> of the Myſteries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but to the very <hi>truth</hi> of them, which is à further ſtep; and we muſt ſtep ſo far, becauſe the <hi>evidence of the obligation grounded on Gods Command,</hi> will have us do ſo.

                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6 For à further explanation of this ſpeculative matter. Note firſt. That known diſtinction between the <hi>Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of à Myſtery and the <hi>Truth</hi> thereof, is carefully to be reflected on, which the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> and all thoſe who cry againſt the rayſing Faith above the Motives, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully confound.

                     <p n="7">7 Note. 2. The motives we here ſpeak of may, as I obſerved in my laſt Treatiſe, be conſidered two wayes. Firſt as anteceding Faith, and naturally known <hi>ex ſenſatis,</hi> being obiects of ſenſe, ſeen, or heard of by undoubted Hiſtory. Thus we have aſſurance that there is in the world à great Moral Body of men called Catholicks, agreeing in the uſe of Sacraments, profeſſing Obedience to one ſupream <hi>Paſtor,</hi> who manifeſtly ſhew the Succeſſion of their Paſtors from the Apoſtles times, give evident Signs of Sanctity in thouſands and thouſands, relate ſuch and ſuch Miracles wrought in the Catholick Church &amp;c. 2. Theſe Motives may be conſidered <hi>as obiects of Faith,</hi> and numbred among other <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="8">8 Note. 3. God has right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us two wayes. Firſt by making his revealed will evidently known, which implies, as Divines ſpeak, <hi>Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam in Atteſtante,</hi> or à clear ſight of his command, and ſpeaking. 2. This ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Lord, in caſe he make his will known by <hi>Signs</hi> evidently Credible, has yet as much right to require obedience from us as if it were evident, he ſpeak's. One clear Inſtance will give light to my Aſſertion. An abſolute Prince ſet's forth à Proclamation, and ſome eye or eare-witneſſes receive it from his own mouth, and know it to be his: Soon after the publick <hi>Cryer</hi> proclaim's it in other places, diſtant from the Court. I ſay thoſe who hear it proclaimed, and ſe it atteſted by the Princes own marks and ſignatures, are as much obliged to yeild Obedience to it, as if they had received the contents of it from the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. <note place="margin">The right God has, to Command Faith.</note> Pray, tell me, did you ever yet know that any town or City in England though diſtant from Court, when his
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93042:89"/> 
                        <hi>Majesty</hi> ſet's forth à proclamation <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritively</hi> ſealed by his own hand, boggle thus? It may be the publick <hi>Cryer</hi> ſeign's, what is not. It may be he has received à forged Writ, It may be, he knowes not the King's mind, therefore we will neither obey, nor aſſent to the <hi>Truth of it,</hi> but after all theſe Cryes and Signs only hold <hi>it credible,</hi> that ſuch is the Kings pleaſure, his will, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Apply this to our preſent caſe and you have all. God's Revelation hath been proclaimed the whole world over. <hi>Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> commiſſioned to ſpeak aloud, have Age after age publiſhed it, and made the truth of it <hi>evidently Credible</hi> by clearer Signs then ever Prince ſet forth his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation. Have we the Princes own Seal and Marks for the one, we have Gods own Seal and Marks for the other. It is true, we ſaw not the Prince ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning his law or Proclamation, and therefore want that evidence of <hi>Truth</hi> conſidered in it ſelf, no more ſaw we the Truth of God's Revelation when he firſt ſpake by his Prophets, and Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, <note place="margin">How faith is mode Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.</note> but the <hi>Signatures of his Truths</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to his Revelation remain ſtill, and will do ſo to the worlds end. And
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93042:89"/> what after all theſe glorious ſigns, ſhall we ſtand trifling with God in ſo weighty an affair as concern's eternal Salvation? Shall we tell him, becauſe we ſe not evidently the Truth of his Revelation <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> but only the <hi>evident Credibility</hi> of it, we will proceed warily and aſſent to its <hi>Credibility,</hi> but with all either abſtract from the Truth, or abſolutly deny it. I am ſure Chriſt delivered contrary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, when he told S. Thomas. <hi>Beati qui non viderunt &amp; crediderunt,</hi> nameing thoſe bleſſed, who ſe not, yet believe. Thus much noted.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 I ſay firſt. The evident Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of à Revelation, obliges all to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it, not only as <hi>evidently Credible</hi> (for ſo much is manifeſt without any <note place="margin">what the Motives perſwade to.</note> Submiſſion) but to aſſent to it as moſt abſolutely true, and in this ſence Faith goes above the light of Motives. One reaſon hereof is already given. If an earthly King can oblige his ſubjects to obey à law <hi>as truly his,</hi> made <hi>evidently Credible</hi> as is now declared, much more can the King of Kings lay that obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon all, when his Revelation is made evidently Credible by Signs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the power of nature. Again. Evident Credibility founded on rational
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93042:90"/> Motives perſwad's and oblig's men to believe ſome thing, as the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> grant's. I ask what? They need not to perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de to à belief of themſelves, becauſe their Evidence is ſeen before aſſent be given to the Revelation, and therefore both perſwade, and oblige all to believe the Infallible <hi>Truth of the Revelation,</hi> though not evidently ſeen.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 I Argue. 3. and this reaſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. The bleſſed Apoſtles firmly believed Chriſt our Lord to be truly God, à <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and the long expected <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi> and reſted not in this judgement alone. <hi>It is only evidently Credible, that Chriſt is God,</hi> or the true <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and <note place="margin">How the bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</note> conſequently their Faith went above the force of all the Motives laid open to their eyes, and ſenſes.</p>
                     <p n="12">12 I prove the conſequence mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly. Conſider that great Miracle of rayſing Lazarus from his grave, <hi>meerly as ſeen</hi> or known by ſenſe, and preceded Faith, none can ſay that, that wonder (the like is of all other Miracles) evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proved Chriſt to be God, or the true <hi>Meſſias.</hi> For God might have wrought that Miracle for ſome other end, than to aſſure any of Chriſt's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. Nay, he might have impowred an Angel or à man not priviledged with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93042:90"/> the Hypoſtatical union to call one dead, to life again, as the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> did. <hi>Kings.</hi> 3. 17. 21. Yea and to do all the Miracles which Chriſt wrought. What followes therefore from the ſight of theſe Miracles? Thus much only and no more, that as that poor widow of Seraptia truly judged <hi>Elias,</hi> after his giving life to her Son, <hi>to be à man ſent from God, and that all be ſpake was true,</hi> ſo the Apoſtles might rationally have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that our Saviours Miracles were indeed from à Power above the force of <note place="margin">What force Miracles, as ſeen have?</note> nature, but that He was thereby <hi>evidently</hi> proved God, appeared no evident infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible verity deduced from his wonders. Yet thoſe bleſſed men, and the Primitive Chriſtians firmly believed all theſe Truths by Infallible Faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as I ſaid now, went above the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Motives, which, <hi>as ſeen,</hi> afforded no ſuch <hi>infallible certainty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13 Some may ſay. If all thoſe glorious Miracles wrought by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, neither gave evidence of his being God, nor <hi>ſolely</hi> taken, ultimately deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined any to believe his Divinity, or ſo much as one Revealed verity; How came the Apoſtles and all Orthodox Chriſtians with them to raiſe their Faith ſo high, as to believe infallibly Chriſts
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93042:91"/> ſacred Doctrin? I anſwer. Three things chiefly brought their Faith to <note place="margin">Three things neceſſary for faith,</note> this perfection. <hi>Prodigious works,</hi> or Miracles <hi>(as ſeen)</hi> perſwaded much; Our Saviours ſacred words, <hi>as heard,</hi> by thoſe he taught, added more ſtrength, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the pious affection of the Will in every Believer that ſaw theſe works, and heard his words, when drawn on and encouraged by <hi>Christ's Command to</hi> eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Faith, paſſed through all difficulties to the Contrary, and moved the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to believe <hi>infallibly</hi> the truth of what ever that great Maſter did ſpeak.</p>
                     <p n="14">14 Shall I yet touch upon theſe particulars more plainly? All know that the greateſt Miracles which were ever done without words or Doctrin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by him that wrought them, make not our Chriſtian Verities known, for had Chriſt appeared in the world and given life to twenty dead men, and all that time never ſpoken word of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, none could have apprehended what to believe of <hi>our Chriſtian Myſteries.</hi> Thoſe therefore who ſaw his Miracles might well have thought him ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary perſon ſent from God (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">are further explicated.</note> Divels cannot reſtore life to the dead) but could never know by thoſe wonders, what he judged of <hi>Divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:93042:91"/> before they heard him ſpeak. 2. Words alone without miraculous works induce none to believe; wherefore, had Chriſt come amongſt us, and only told us, he was God and the true <hi>Meſsias,</hi> and wrought no Miracles, ſhewed no ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or auſterity of life, neither Iewes nor Gentils, nor indeed any, could in prudence have believed him. Hereof, ſe more in my notes upon Pooles Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix <hi>n.</hi> 21. and learn withall; that Chriſt's <hi>admirable works and ſacred words ioyntly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> highly conduce to beget Divine Faith in all. <hi>I ſay Ioyntly taken,</hi> whereof we have an Inſtance in that glorious Transfiguration upon Mount Thabor.

Diſc. 1. c. 5. n.</hi> 6. that all the power in Heaven cannot ſeparate Infallibility from an act of Faith ſetled upon the <hi>Truth</hi> of God's Revelation, though Divines yet que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether by the abſolute power of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:93042:93"/> God, all theſe outward Signs we ſe or hear of, might not have been the very ſame in appearance as they are now, had God never revealed any thing.</p>
                     <p n="18">18 Some leſs skilful may reply. The words the Apoſtles heard on Mount Tabor and underſtood, were plain and ſignificant enough, what need <note place="margin">Truth is not alwaies Spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by words, moſt ſignificant.</note> is there of more? A ſimple objection. Are I beſeech you all ſignificant words true? Grant this, and no man can tell à Lye, or à falſe ſtory, for in ſuch caſes, words are very ſignificant, yet far from truth. Now the Apoſtles did not only know the ſignification of that voice heard, but alſo believed its <hi>Truth,</hi> though not made <hi>evident</hi> to them. This is ever to be reflected on.</p>
                     <p n="19">19 You will ſay again. Thoſe words and all other written in Scripture, are either evidently <hi>Credible,</hi> or <hi>evidently true.</hi> Anſw.

                     <p n="20">20 Followes another obiection much to this ſence. There ſeem's an open conteſt between theſe Signs or the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives inducing to Faith on the one ſide; and God's expreſs command whereby we are obliged to believe the truth of his Revelation, on the other. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives draw one way, and licence us not to goe one ſtep further than to aſſent to what they ſhew, <hi>which is only to acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge God's Revelation evidently Credible,</hi> but not infallibly true. God's Command puſhes further, and will have all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Truth</hi> of à Revelation, though we ſe no reaſon, to go ſo high by Faith. This obiection contain's nothing but

I therefore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <note place="margin">An obiection taken from the Motives, and Gods Command, ſolved.</note> in a word. We ſe no reaſon to goe ſo high, while we reſt upon the Motives only, I grant it; we ſe no reaſon to goe ſo high, if we attend to God's command manifeſted by clear ſigns, I deny what is aſſumed. For, this command, and the Majeſty of the commander, is both <hi>reaſon and à law more prevalent</hi> than all Motives are, ſolely conſidered, or, as known by ſenſe. Therefore unleſs the weaknes of theſe Motives can as it were abate or infringe the ſtrength of God's Command and make me to judge he command's none to believe without evidence had of his Revelation, I both can and will captivate my underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in <hi>obſequium fidei,</hi> and ſay abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely, what ever you my God ſpeak <hi>(made evidently credible by clear ſignes)</hi> is not only Credible, but infallibly true. And this is to proceed rationally, for if I ought to believe à Mortal man reputed honeſt and ſincere when he ſpeak's, though I have no evidence of what he interiourly judges, <hi>becauſe he may deceive,</hi> much more am I obliged by captivating my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to believe God, <hi>who cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> when I have the greateſt moral Aſſurance imaginable, that he ſpeak's to me, and for my Salvation.</p>

The very chief aime whereof, is, to ſhew
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93042:100"/> not only to Chriſtians, but to Iewes and Gentils alſo, that the firſt known ground of true Religion, is à Church manifeſted by Supernatural Motives proceeding from an infinit power and wiſdom.

                     <p n="6">6 This difficulty I have both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in expreſs terms, and ſolved. <hi>Reas. Relig:</hi> Diſc. 3. <hi>C. 16. n.</hi> 25. and ſay there, an act of Faith may be conſidered two wayes. Firſt as it is à <hi>prudent reaſonable ſubmiſſion</hi> to what ever God reveals. 2. as terminated upon the Revelation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Church, or any other infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Oracle. Under the firſt notion of <hi>à prudent ſubmiſsion,</hi> it either neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, or preſuppoſes the rational pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent judgment <hi>of credibility</hi> ſet faſt on ſuch Motives as converted the world, which judgement rightly denominat's Faith à <hi>reaſonable Obſequiouſneſs.</hi> But again conſider the act in it ſelf, I mean as it preciſely tend's upon the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and à Myſtery not <hi>evidently ſeen,</hi> it <note place="margin">where an Act of Faith reaſons not?</note> cannot reaſon at all, nor more prove, or <hi>Scientifically</hi> know its obiect <hi>(as it reſt's there)</hi> than <hi>Science</hi> as <hi>ſcience</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Thus I then anſwered, and though the Doctor hitherto never took the leaſt notice of my reply,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93042:104"/> yet we ſhall find him hereafter when his <hi>rational Evidence of Chriſtian Religion</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to à trial, much born down with this very difficulty.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 In the mean while to give ſome hints at what I ſhall then ſay. I ask when the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> (who talks much of Faiths evidence) believes the Myſtery of the Incarnation upon this ſole ground that God reveals it in Scripture, what ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal evidence can he derive into his Faith, if you preciſely conſider it, as fixed upon <hi>the Revelation and Myſtery together?</hi> None ariſes from the nature of theſe things <hi>purely believed,</hi> unleſs he ſtoutly affirm (and he is as like to do it as any man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) that he evidently ſee's by his new eyes of Faith the intrinſick <hi>infallible truth of the Revelation</hi> in it ſelf, as alſo the two natures in Chriſt, <hi>Humane and Divine.</hi> I ſay by <hi>virtue of that act,</hi> as it is preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terminated upon the obiect believed, which if I rightly underſtand him. <hi>P. 387. fine,</hi> he acknowledges <hi>to be obſcure,</hi> and upon that account unmeet to ground Evidence? What then is to be done? O, ſaith the Dr I will fetch my Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce not from the <hi>Nature of the things belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> for they are remote and dark, but from the evidence of ſenſe <hi>as to the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought by Chriſt,</hi> from the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93042:104"/> thoſe who ſaw Chriſt our Lord, and have delivered his Doctrin to us, and given the greateſt Evidence of their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity &amp;c. Se his pages. 387 and 416. Very good, let all yet be as he pleaſes.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Hence it followes firſt. That the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> act of Faith as it tend's upon the Revelation, <hi>not evidently ſeen, and an obſcure</hi> Myſtery together, is ſo far blind, yea and like <hi>a Mole,</hi> working without light (They are his own words <hi>P.</hi> 353) as that Faith is, which he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn, <note place="margin">The Dr own's Faith both clear and obſcure</note> and this I chiefly inſiſt upon at preſent. It followes. 2. That his one indiviſible act of Faith is both clear and obſcure; as fixed upon his ſuppoſed evident Motives, it is clear, and under another reſpect <hi>obſcure,</hi> as it adheres to an <hi>obſcure obiect believed.</hi> For ſo he ſpeak's. <hi>P. 387. I had rather thought,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the more obſcure the obiect had been (for its little better then Non-ſence to call an act of Faith obſcure) the greater neceſsity there had been of strong evidence to perſwade</hi> &amp;c. One word, Mr Dr by the way. I think it far greater Nonſence to call obiects <hi>à parte rei</hi> obſcure, if we uſe proper lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. A pore blind man ſtumbles at à ſtone, is the ſtone therefore obſcure, while another ſees it clearly, and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles not? Thus all obiects obſcure to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93042:105"/> our weak Capacities, are clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to God and Angels. Clarity and obſcurity, Mr D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, as I have often noted (but you never mend your faults when told of them) are inſeparable proprieties of vital operations, and belong not to <hi>Things</hi> in rigour of ſpeech, though in à vulgar way with à reſpect to our acts, the language may paſs. Again, ſhift all you will, if the obiect in your ſence be obſcure, your act of Faith, as it is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed upon that clouded <hi>verity,</hi> cannot but under that notion and reſpect, be obſcure alſo.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 It followes. 3. That, had the Dr pitch't on the true Evidence of Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which is not done, I have all that for my Faith with much more to boot taken from the Churches <hi>long continuance,</hi> Her <hi>Miracles, Sanctity, Converſions,</hi> and <hi>other Motives.</hi> Whereof ſee, <hi>Reaſ. and Relig. Diſc: 2. C.</hi> 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. Now if the Evidence of Credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity once eſtabliſhed neceſſary in the Church, be ever prerequired as an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement to believe (as all confeſs) it little import's Chriſtianity, whether it be diſcovered by the <hi>very act of Faith,</hi> or the <hi>Iudgement previous</hi> to Faith, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, as I ſaid above, that this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inform's and illuminat's the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93042:105"/> chiefly at every mans firſt Converſion. Did I come ſhort of the <note place="margin">where the Evidence of Credibility is found.</note> Dr in the evidence of Credibility, he might juſtly blame me, but when in reallity he has none, as we ſhall ſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and I introduce ſuch an Evidence <hi>as converted the world,</hi> Say I beſeech you wherein am I faulty? Marry in this may the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> reply, that I allow not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the very act of Faith, but only to the previous judgement of Credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. No hurt at all, while the mind has the evidence of Credibility laid open, and the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> very act of Faith (ſuch an one as it is) is partly clear, partly obſcure.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 But to quiet the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> I can without prejudice to my Opinion, much leſs to Chriſtian Religion, grant with many learned Divines, that one indiviſible act of Faith reſt's both upon the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, and the revealed Myſtery toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nay more, I do hold that the Motives are <hi>God's own language</hi> whereby he ſpeak's to the world, not imitable by any Enemy, <hi>for, etiam factis loquitur Deus,</hi> as S.

The Revelation therefore obſcurely propoſed to us cannot, as <hi>obſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,</hi> be the <hi>rational ground</hi> of our firm aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to it, and for this reaſon to avoyd confuſion in the <hi>Analyſis,</hi> I attribute Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the previous judgement of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility and not <hi>to the very act of Faith.</hi> Though I ſcruple nothing to grant that I believe alſo <hi>for the Motives,</hi> which, as I now ſaid, have their influence upon Faith, and therefore the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> flatly calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat's, when he tell's me over and over, that I believe without reaſon, without grounds and Motives; That I have Motives and evident Motives <hi>(P.</hi> 382). yet after all this Evidence, believing hath nothing to do with them. <hi>Iuſt as if à man should ſay</hi> (P. 384.) <hi>there is à par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular way of ſeing with ones eyes shut.</hi> He might better have ſaid, his intellectual Eyes were darkened when he read my <note place="margin">The Dr's cavil, groundleſs.</note> Treatiſe, for no Author ever gave greater ſtrength and efficacy to the Motives then I have done, when I ſay not only Faith, but Chriſt alſo, the Church, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all true Religion goes to wrack without them. I further aſſert, that à Believers mind is ſo far from being in à

                        <hi>ſtate of darkneſs,</hi> in the inſtant it elicits Faith, that even then it is environed with the light of theſe Motives, clearly repreſented by the judgement of credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the luſtre whereof is ſo great, that as many Divines teach, they make Faith evident in <hi>Atteſtance.</hi> This opinion I could maintain, and yet defend the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of Faith in order to its <hi>Material obiect,</hi> as the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> withall his pretended Evidence muſt do, whereof more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>

Nay more; in the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, Principles, that Article of our Creed. I believe the Holy Church ſtands there to no purpoſe, becauſe forſooth, in ſome extraordinary circumſtances and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions Faith may be had without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>of the Church,</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>of Chriſt alſo:</hi> For many Divines hold, that Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians by meer contemplating the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble works in nature, may without the <hi>teaching of à living Oracle</hi> come to the

                     <p n="2">2 The unſoundneſs, or rather Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence whereof, I will demonſtrate againſt Mr D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. The ancient Chriſtians had true Faith before the Canon of Scripture was extant. Now that holy Book being publiſhed and received all over, our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ground's his Faith upon it, only <note place="margin">Ancient Chriſtians had true Faith, befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſcripture was written.</note> as its underſtood by every man's diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faculty, what therefore once was no rule nor ground of Faith (becauſe not in being) afterward becomes à ground when it is known and publiſhed. Juſt thus we diſcourſe of the Church. When the woman of Samaria and ſome Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians believed, the Church was not founded, nor known or owned by all as Gods Oracle, but afterward the foundation of it being perfectly laid, and Paſtors and Doctors appointed by Chriſt to teach the world, it was owned for God's Oracle, and then brought with it an obligation upon all to hear and believe it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The reaſon hereof, more amply laid forth in my laſt Treatiſe, is taken
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93042:111"/> from the expreſs conſtitution of Chriſt, who erected the Church as à moſt <hi>facile, clear,</hi> and <hi>living Rule of Faith.</hi> This great Maſter aſſures all, that <hi>whoever hear's the Church; hear's him.</hi> That <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> and therefore Paſtors and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors are appointed to teach to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of Saints, unto the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, for the edifying of Christ's Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body</hi> &amp;c. Wherefore Baronus in his <hi>Apodixis. Tract: 9. puncto.</hi> 2. ingenuouſly profeſſes. <hi>That the Testimony of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church is à condition neceſſarily required to believe the authority of the Scripture, becauſe Faith comes by hearing.</hi> Hence I argue. A law made by Chriſt is to be obſerved, the ordinary means appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Law-giver Himſelfe for the grounding of Faith, ought in no caſe to be neglected. But Chriſt hath obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all who believe, to rely on <hi>the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church ever ſince She was made an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle known to the world,</hi> as is largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Reas.</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> through the whole Second Diſcourſe, therefore though <hi>by accident</hi> or in ſome very unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual <hi>circumſtance,</hi> men have had Faith without any knowledge either of Scripture, or Church, Yet now after
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93042:112"/> the Churches compleat <hi>eſtablishment,</hi> and <hi>Her long continuance</hi> to exclude her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and believe upon any other <hi>ground</hi> would be ſo great folly and raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that God may juſtly deny his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Grace to ſuch unadviſed Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who therefore would not have Faith to Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Pray you tell me, ſhould à Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian that never heard of Church or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet may probably believe in God, as à <hi>Rewarder of Good,</hi> by à meer contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Heavens &amp;c. Should, I ſay, ſuch an one come to the knowledge <hi>of Chriſt,</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>of the Church,</hi> gloriouſly illuſtrated with all her Motives, Can this man, think you, in theſe new circumſtances <hi>of à greater light,</hi> neglect all, and believe, that God will reward good upon the <hi>old motive,</hi> to <hi>wit, the viſible beauty or motion of the Heavens?</hi> No; That belief would <hi>now</hi> be impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and upon that account unavaila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">The Dr's grand Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, proved forceleſs</note> to Salvation, <hi>VVhat therefore ſerves to ground Faith in ſome circumſtances, ſerves not in all.</hi> We have yet another Inſtance againſt the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, who hold's there is à Thing in being called the Church of England, where he preaches, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend's to ſettle his Faith upon Scripture only.

Yet he muſt, if he proceed conſequently, to his indigeſted Diſcourſe, for the Faith of that Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan woman and Barbarians alſo was <hi>truly Divine,</hi> and why may not his People believe as they did independently of all Scripture, and the Church of Englands Doctrin, as he would now have us to believe independently of the Catholick Churches Teſtimony? For here is his Principle, or he ſpeak's Non-ſence. What was once ſufficient to propound or ground Faith, <hi>may be ever ſufficient, and in all circumſtances.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5 One may reply. That Samaritan and Barbarians likewiſe, believed upon <hi>God's word</hi> not then written, but ſpoken, which afterward became <hi>the Doctrin of Scripture.</hi> Very right, and ſo ſay I, they believed upon that Doctrin which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was, is, and ever will be taught by the Church, but as then there was no
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93042:113" rendition="simple:additions"/> written Scripture. So there was no Church founded to propoſe or ground Faith upon. And thus the <hi>Proponent</hi> of Faith may vary, though the ultimate Motive <hi>or formal obiect</hi> of it, which is Gods Revelation never changes. <hi>The variety of an Infallible Oracle, varies not the Formal obiect of Faith.</hi>

It was <hi>expedient</hi> that Chriſt ſhould dy, and though à wicked man ſpake the words, yet the Spirit of truth which guided his tongue <hi>(for he ſpake not of himſelf)</hi> erred not.

Now whether all the ſubordinate Judges of the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin</hi> were infallible, is à new queſtion not pertinent to the matter in hand.

In that Diſcourſe of à Heathen with à Chriſtian, he will find the firſt difficulty largely handled, and ſolved, where I ſay, the Dr either believes our Saviours unparalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Miracles, becauſe Scripture relates them, and then he ſuppoſes Scripture <hi>to be Divine or inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which the Heathen denies, and therefore wiſhes that Divine inſpiration to be proved by Arguments extrinſical to the Doctrin delivered in Scripture. Or, contrarywiſe, he proves thoſe Miracles to have been, upon the <hi>Fallible report</hi> of men liable to errour (the Dr own's no Tradition Infallible) and this advances not his cauſe at all, for do not the Turk's ſpeak as much of Mahomets Miracles, upon fallible and perhaps falſe reports alſo? Thus the Heathen argues, and rationally too, not yet knowing what Religion to embrace. Here in à word you have the ſubſtance of all I then ſaid, and I think my Argument thus delivered convinces. <hi>VVhoever proves Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be aſſuredly true by Motives as obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re as the very Doctrin of Chriſtian Religion is, either evinces nothing, or makes à vicious</hi>

                     <p n="3">3 The whole ſubſtance comes to this. <hi>Senſe is ſometimes deceived,</hi> or to ſpeak properly, <hi>reaſon upon the ſuggeſtion of ſenſe err's: Ergo,</hi> it may alwaies err and be deceived, in its proper obiect.

                        <hi>Take away the certainty of the judgement of ſenſe, you deſtroy all certainty in Religion.</hi> I have anſwered. We neither take away the Obiect of ſenſe, nor like well his <hi>miſcalled</hi> judgement of ſenſe, for ſenſe hath ſtill its own <hi>proper obiect,</hi> though were it otherwiſe in this Myſtery, his Inference of <hi>all certainty deſtroyed</hi> has no Sence in it. 3.

                     <p n="7">7 The Solution of all in à word is. Our ſenſes in this Myſtery are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, nor ſo much beguiled as the eye is, when we ſe à ſtraight ſtick crooked in the water, for here the <hi>Medium</hi> makes that to appear crooked

Thus much noted, I challenge and charge the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in his next Anſwer any thing like à fallacy in my whole Diſcourſe. But when will this be done think ye? Then I ſay (and not ſooner) when the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> makes this Conſequence good. <hi>If Chriſt changed bread, retaining the outward ſemblance of bread into his own body;</hi> we may prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge, that he alſo changed thoſe ſtones the Divel ſhew'd him. <hi>Matt:</hi> 4. into good bakers bread, though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly they ſtill appeared ſtones. The firſt change is grounded upon as great Authority as any Myſtery of Faith is, (none excepted) For the ſecond, we have nothing but fancy only. Now if after all I have ſaid, the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> as his uſual <note place="margin">If the Dr tell his old ſtories over again, he will be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led à Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gler.</note> cuſtome hath been, ſilently paſſes by my reaſons hitherto alledged, and only tells his old ſtories over again of our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being deceived &amp;c. I ſhall retort his own words upon him, and conclude,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:93042:125"/> that his School find's no anſwer to my Arguments.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Another grand errour of this Dr is, that he attributes more to the Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of ſenſe in order to its proper obiect (à viſible Miracle for example) than can be allowed. The Senſe of ſeing (take this for an Inſtance, the like is of feeling hearing &amp;c) is only terminated upon the outward appearance of things, and, as it penetrat's not the ſubſtance of the bread, ſo neither ſee's it the inward life or motion of the Soul in à mortal body. Whence it followes, though we grant that Senſe is never beguiled, as to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per obiect, yet it often gives occaſion of deceipt in other matters, wholly out of the reach of ſenſe. You ſhall ſe what I here hint at by one Inſtance. Suppoſe the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſaw the Divel, that often trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form's himſelf into an Angel of light doing his feates, to delude the ſenſes with à falſe Miracle, or, if he denies Divels, he muſt grant that power to Antichriſt, who will ſhew many ſeeming wonders. Suppoſe this be one, <hi>that à man in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance</hi> dead to all ſenſes by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts Charms, ſtand's up again, and moves as others do. I ask, how will the Dr who gives ſo much credit to his eyes and ſenſes diſtinguiſh <hi>by Senſe only</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:93042:126"/> the true reſuſcitation of <hi>Iairus</hi> daughter Luke. 8. 55. and this counter feit Miracle of Antichriſt? In his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples he cannot difference them, if gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Evidence of ſenſe</hi> and all that reaſon Can diſcover by Senſe only.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Hence to take off the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, errour, as to the Bleſſed Sacrament, we diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe further. He Iudges what he ſee's in <note place="margin">The Dr by virtue of his own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, muſt own Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, for true Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> a conſecrated Hoſt to be truly bread, becauſe his eyes and ſenſes tell him it is bread. Theſe the Dr thinks give in ſtronger Evidence for its being bread, than any proof to the contrary, can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, that it is not bread. Yeild this (and the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> yeilds all) He is obliged to own this ſeeming Miracle of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt for à true Miracle, becauſe his eyes and ſenſes will have it true, I prove it? The exteriour Evidence in both Caſes is the very Same, for as ſenſe ſee's and feel's this man to be like one truly dead, <hi>though he is not dead,</hi> So it alſo ſee's and fee'ls this wafer after Conſecration to be like true bread, <hi>though it be not bread,</hi> and reaſon, as I now ſaid, purely led on by the conduct of ſenſe judges alike in both caſes, therefore if the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form's his Judgement to the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his ſenſes in the one, and truly hold's à conſecrated hoſt to be bread, he
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:93042:126"/> cannot but upon the ſame Evidence Judge, that Antichriſt's Miracle is à true Miracle. No diſparity can be given. O! but Scripture ſo often fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning us of Antichriſt's falſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, much abates, yea wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes every ſound Chriſtian from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>them true.</hi> Is it poſſible? Can Scripture let in ſo much light upon us? Can it make us to deny what <hi>our eyes ſee,</hi> and <hi>fingers feel,</hi> to be true? Why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot the cleareſt words that Chriſt ever Spake. <hi>This is my body My flesh is meat indeed. My blood is drink indeed,</hi> force us to deny the weak ſuggeſtion of our Senſes called by the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, <hi>the Stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Evidence?</hi> Why ſhould not thoſe Sacred words move us Submiſſively to confeſs, that as no real Miracle lies under that outward guiſe of Antichriſt's <note place="margin">What plain Scripture forces on us to believe in the bleſſed Sacrament.</note> apparent wonder, (Scripture drawes us to own this truth) So no real bread lies under the outward apparence or viſible forms of bread and wine, or if Scripture work's ſo powerfully upon us as not to believe that to be bread which to our Senſes looks like bread, where in is Our offence greater than the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>'<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, who believes that to be no true Miracle which to our Senſes looks like a true one?
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:93042:127"/> In à word the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> muſt either quit his ſo much cryed up <hi>Evidence</hi> taken from <hi>Senſe,</hi> or will be forced to grant (which is horrid) that Antichriſt Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="10">10 Again, how can the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Aſſert that Chriſt's Miracles wrought before the writing of Scripture, were done to confirm all the Doctrin regiſtred by S.

Nay, how can he prove they were wrought to confirm the truth of our Saviours own Doctrin without giving ſome further proof, then the <hi>outward ſight of à Miracle,</hi> is? Hence I ſaid the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> erred, when he told us that <hi>the aſſurance of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion came from the judgement of the ſenſes of thoſe who were Eye-witneſſes of the Miracles, and the Reſurrection of Chriſt.</hi> Firſt no Eye-witneſſes ſaw our Saviour actually ryſing from the dead (but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) yet had they ſeen him in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, can the Dr judge that the aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the Apoſtles Faith came <hi>from that ſight?</hi> Doth he or any ground Faith upon the ſight of thoſe who beheld Chriſts Miracles, while the very beſt Eye-witneſſes believed not, becauſe they ſaw them, but upon this ſtrong <hi>Motive,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt told them he was ſent from God to teach eternal truth,</hi> and that now riſen

Now if the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> tell us, when he ſaies the aſſurance of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion came from the <hi>judgement of ſenſe,</hi> his meaning only was, that the ſight of thoſe Miracles were <hi>Inducements</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſt's revealed Doctrin, and made that (not evidently ſeen) <hi>evidently credible,</hi> He firſt ſpeaks improperly in calling thoſe viſible matters of fact the <hi>Foundations of Faith (Account P.</hi> 119), And. 2. deſtroyes the certainty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrin, by endeavouring to prove it <hi>immediatly true,</hi> before he evinces it <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently credible:</hi> And this he doth by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing à new ſet of Motives (diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe of the Catholick Church) which both Jewes and Gentils ſcorn, and in reallity neither evidence <hi>the Truth to ſuch men,</hi> nor the <hi>Credibility</hi> of Chriſtian Religion, much leſſe have any reference to the <hi>Thing</hi> he calls Proteſtancy, as will appear afterward.</p>

Put the book of holy Scripture into the hands of à Heathen Philoſopher, who never heard of Chriſt, of the Church, or of any other Motive for Chriſtian Religion, but only takes ſo much as the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, <hi>and what the Scripture it ſelfe barely relates.</hi> Would this Philoſopher, think ye, after his pondering the Dr'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and reading Scripture, forthwith acquieſſe and ſay all is true, he reads?

                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14 The ultimate reaſon hereof is moſt convincing. All matters contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture, whether <hi>Miracles</hi> or <note place="margin">The reaſon of their nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſaid forth,</note>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Church proved Infallible before She interpret's Scripture. The reaſon hereof. The Doctors groſs errour in charging à Circle on us, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of Faith. VVhat à vicious Circle implies, and how it differ's from à rational Regreſs in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1 THe reſt that followes in the Dr from. P. 423. is all along meer <hi>Confuſion,</hi> or à horrid jumbling in à ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative matter concerning the reſolution of Faith, and <hi>the notion of à vicious Circle,</hi> which he truly underſtand's not, but wonder nothing, you can expect no better from halfe Scholars in ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve learning, if I make not what I here aſſert manifeſt, blame me boldly.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 To reſcue my Doctrin from Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, (and the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, if I ever met with any, is one) I am forced to ſet down plainly part of it, That done, you ſhall ſe how remote the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> is from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with it.

Seing Scripture evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences not it ſelfe to <hi>be divinely inſpired,</hi> ſome other Infallible Oracle, diſtinct from Scripture, neceſſarily <hi>aſcertain's</hi> that <note place="margin">The Church not firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</note> 
                        <hi>Truth,</hi> and this is the Church, which as rationally proves herſelfe by Signs and Miracles an Oracle whereby God ſpeaks <hi>independently of Scripture,</hi> as ever any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle proved himſelf to be ſo, before Scripture was written. Hence I infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Church was ever, and is yet <hi>in à General way</hi> believed infallible <hi>by Her ſelf,</hi> and <hi>for Her ſelf,</hi> upon this ground, that God ſpeaks by Her <hi>as his own Oracle,</hi> and then concluded, that She is not in the <hi>firſt place</hi> proved infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible by Scripture. I ſay in à <hi>General way,</hi> for thus the Apoſtles believed our Saviour to be the true Meſſias, before they received from him à full Account of many other particular Chriſtian Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, learned after that <hi>General acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3 Thus much and more, amply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the place now cited, comes Dr Still: in his laſt book. <hi>P.</hi> 424. with his old Tautologies, and asks again, as if nothing <hi>had been ſaid,</hi> why we believe the Churches Infallibility, and verily think's,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:93042:142"/> we have no other way to make out Her Infallibility, <hi>but only by Scripture?</hi> Is not this worſe then jumbling? Reflect good Reader. I ſhew that the Church in the firſt place is proved <hi>infallible</hi> without recourſe at all had to Scripture (for ſo She was proved infallible before Scriptures were written) and here he out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces me with empty words, ſaying I cannot prove the Church infallible but <hi>by Scripture only?</hi> In <hi>lieu</hi> of this ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Reply. He ſhould have refuted my reaſons, and this is one. No man can aſcertain any that Scripture is <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely inſpired,</hi> or render the true ſence of it relating to <hi>Neceſſaries</hi> for Salvation, but one only infallible Church. Therefore the Church which only can give certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe truths, muſt neceſſarily be firſt owned infallible before we recurr <note place="margin">It is Sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to prove the Church by Scripture, before Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be Proved God's word.</note> to Scripture, for it is more than Sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to prove by Scripture the Churches <hi>Infallibility,</hi> or any other Article <hi>of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith,</hi> before we have abſolute Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that the <hi>Book whereby we argue is Gods word,</hi> and know what <hi>its meaning</hi> is in à hundred difficult paſſages, But thus much is only known by Church Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as is amply proved in the place now cited.</p>

And if God ſpeake by it, there is no want of an <hi>Infallible Testimony.</hi> I challenge the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> to anſwer my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon this ſubiect hitherto never taken notice of, neither ſhall he hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reply without apparent ſhuffling (to uſe his words) and running away from the main difficulty, here treated.

The Prophet <hi>Ioel.</hi> 2. 28. long before <hi>S.

Peter, <hi>which was ſaid, or foretold by the Prophet Ioel.</hi> Obſerve well. S. Peter was proved an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Oracle before he interpreted this Paſſage of an Infallible Prophet, ſo is the Church proved Infallible before She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret's any words in Scripture. S.

Finally, as that <hi>darker Sence</hi> of the Prophet, made clear by the Apoſtles Infallible Interpretation, <hi>indiviſibly concurred</hi> to the Faith of the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:93042:144"/> Primitive Chriſtians, ſo alſo the darker Sence of Scripture cleared by the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches interpretation, <hi>indiviſibly</hi> concur's to the Faith of Believers now.</p>

                     <p n="17">17 Obſerve well. This vicious conſequence whereby man ſeem's evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced à free Agent or indowed with liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, takes all the force it hath from the Antecedent of his being <hi>intellectual,</hi> and

                     <p n="18">18 Now on the other ſide, ſhould I take this Conſequence concerning Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is deduced from the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of mans being intellectual; Should I prove that Conſequence upon other grounds, either by Authority, or manifeſt experience, becauſe we ſe men freely eſchew Evil and embrace Good; ſhould I from thence inferr that he is <hi>Intellectual,</hi> the Inference now guarded, by other proofs, barely <hi>ſubſiſt's not upon the ſtrength</hi> of its <hi>Antecedent,</hi> but is à Verity known <hi>aliun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> and therefore is rightly called, <hi>Regreſſus utilis,</hi> à rational, <hi>profitable Regreſs,</hi> free from <note place="margin">The differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce between a Circle, and à profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table way of Arguing.</note> all vicious Circulation.

                     <p n="19">19 Thus much premiſed, we proceed to the matter now in hand, and Aſſert.

                        <hi>Truth,</hi> whereby She is owned and proved God's Infallible Oracle in every thing She teaches concerning Faith; and this independently of Scripture. Here I ſay more. It is impoſſible to prove her <hi>firſt</hi> Infallible by the Sence ſhe gives of Scripture, becauſe that Sence is not known before She interpret's, and no body goes about to prove any thing by meer inſignificant Characters, without their Sence.

                     <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                     <argument>
                        <p>How I formerly argued in behalfe of our Churches Miracles. The Dr in his Enquiry waves my Arguments. Of the difference between Chriſt's Miracles, and thoſe wrought by the Apoſtles, and in the Church. VVhat is meant by Church Miracles. Of the Cheats which run through the Drs whole Enquiry.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p n="1">1. THough little might Suffice to refute the Dr's ſtrange, rambling, and unprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled Diſcourſe; yet becauſe the weightineſs of this matter concerning Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, worthily deſerves à larger Examination, we shall, God willing, beſtow more pains upon it, in another ſmall diſtinct <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> in this, we chiefly inſiſt upon plain matters of fact. Now if you deſire to know how I argued againſt the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> for the truth of our Church Miracles. <hi>Reaſon and Religion.</hi> Diſc: 2. C. 7. 8. you Shall have it very briefly.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I firſt urged C. 7. n. 7. our Saviours <note place="margin">Miracles in the Church fore-told by our Saviour.</note> own Propheſy. Iohn. 14. 12. <hi>I ſay unto you. He that believes in me, the works which I do, he shall do, and greater works then theſe shall he do.</hi> which Truth, even Calvin and other Sectaries
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93042:155"/> upon this Paſſage (far more rational than the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>) apply not to the Apoſtles only, nor to every believing Chriſtian, but aſſert it belong's to the whole Body of the Church. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy without doubt contained à truth, and we ſee it with our eyes evidently fulfilled, not only in the Converſion of whole Nations to Chriſt, juſtly accounted <hi>Miraculous</hi> by S. Auſtin (far more in number then thoſe our Saviour Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted) but alſo, in other Signal wonders wrought by God's Servants in this only Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 To this Authority, frequently urged by Catholick Authors, our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> anſwer's nothing, but as his manner is quarrel's, becauſe I paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel Church Miracles and our Saviours together, and ſeem's to think I difference them not at all, though I with every one moſt willingly grant, that <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> shewed himſelf, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <note place="margin">Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives in working Miracles.</note> 
                        <hi>Thaumaturgus</hi> the world yet beheld, and far ſurpaſſed all Angels and men, whether <hi>Patriarks, Propnets, or Apostles,</hi> in working Miracles. His ſingular Prerogative firſt appeared in this (ſo Faith teaches) <hi>that the wonders he wrought were done by his own Power and Virtue,</hi> as <hi>S. Cyril</hi> upon the. 6. <hi>of Luke</hi> ponder's, without borrowing aſſiſtance from any power above him, for as God, he had no Superiour; wherefore calling the Diſciples together. Matt: 10. He impowred them, powerleſs of themſelves, to do wonders, to caſt out Divels and cure the infirm. 2. As S. Thomas notes. 22. <hi>Queſt 178. a.</hi> 1. The Grace of working Miracles was no Conſtant and permanent Gift imparted to any, ſave only to our Saviour, who by virtue of his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatical
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93042:155"/> union could doe wonders, when and as often as he pleaſed. A third ſingular Prerogative peculiar to Chriſt, aroſe from his being <hi>Lord of the whole world,</hi> and therefore wrought wonders all Nature over. As ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Maſter, he commanded à new Star to shine over him at his birth, and at his death darkned the lights of Heaven, with à word of his mouth he made the figtree barren, and commanded the winds and ſea to obey him. In his Sacred Paſſion he ſplit the rocks, rent the vaile of the Temple, moved the earth, as if all nature had trembled, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the God of Nature dye.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Obſerve now I beſeech you, when we ſay Church Miracles anſwer in number and worth to thoſe of our Saviour, we are far from aſcribing the ſingular Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives <note place="margin">Theſe prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives more particularly, Specifyea.</note> already mentioned to either man or Angel, ſave only to the Word Incarnate. Neither goe we about to perſwade, that the Miracles which Chriſt wrought and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally proved, he was one immediatly ſent from God to redeem the word, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 42, were ever done in the like manner, or Circumſtances by any. For as he was firſt in <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Excellence,</hi> ſo alſo he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed himſelf the firſt moſt Victorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour over Sin and infidelity, vanquishing by his glorious wonders without violent hands, <hi>Iudaiſm</hi> and <hi>Gentiliſm.</hi> Again, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath preeminence above Mortals, that all the Miracles wrought by his Servants, whether Apoſtles or others, may be rightly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93042:156"/> called Chriſt's Miracles, not only becauſe <hi>done in his Name,</hi> but upon this account alſo, that they are wrought by his Power. For if as S. Auſtin teaches, when one Baptizes Chriſt alſo Baptizes with him, upon the ſame reaſon we may juſtly ſay, when à Miracle is wrought by à holy Perſon, Chriſt our Lord by the Power and virtue he gives, works it with him, and therefore is not only the moſt powerful Thaumaturgus, but effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually shewes it in concurring with all, that do theſe wonders.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Notwithſtanding, to verify the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>of greater Wonders,</hi> we ſay, That far more, and of the <hi>like quality</hi> with thoſe of our Saviours, have for the good of mankind, <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> been wrought in the Church, which is evident: <hi>For more blinde</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Our Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wonders, proved</note> 
                        <hi>have ſeen, more lame have walked, more deaf heard, more dead have riſen again,</hi> more poor have received the Goſpel in the latter Ages of the Church, than before, when Chriſt and his Apoſtles preached; Theſe mentioned in the Goſpel. <hi>Matth:</hi> 11. 4.

                        <note place="margin">Converſion of Nations, greater,</note> 
                        <hi>receiving the Goſpel.</hi> Neither can the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay my Aſſertion, but by denying all huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Faith and plain matters of fact, recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſuch as have written largely of this ſubiect. One of the laſt Authors is the Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite <hi>Silvester Petra Sancta,</hi> in his two learned Tomes called, <hi>Thaumaſia verae Religionis.</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Anno</hi> 1643 and 1646. where the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93042:156"/> of the old and new Teſtament are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld, and the Churches continued Miracles, moſt amply ſet down with their undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Proofs. But of this ſubiect more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Now to my ſecond Argument.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 I argued. 2. n. 9. If Miracles, Gods <note place="margin">The Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, laid forth.</note> own Seals and Characters, were at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel rational and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Inducements for men to believe Chriſt's Doctrin, as alſo to diſtinguish <hi>the Orthodox Church</hi> from the Conventicles <hi>of Iewes and Hereticks,</hi> There is the like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of their Continuance in after Ages. The reaſon hereof is thus given. n. 11. The Converſion of Infidels to Chriſt was not wrought by the Apoſtles only, <hi>or all at once,</hi> but ſucceſſively in the enſuing Ages, when other Infidels roſe up as barbarous, as uncivilized, and Ignorant of Chriſt's Doctrin as the former converted by the Apoſtles had been, if therefore Miracles were wholly Neceſſary, when thoſe firſt bleſſed men preached, How come they now to be unneceſſary, when theſe latter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels are preach't to, and gain'd to Chriſt? Theſe never made ſo happie à change becauſe they heard Truths <hi>barely taught,</hi> but were convinced upon this ſtrong Motive, that very many frequently ſaw our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Verities Confirmed by Signs and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from Heaven. Se this reaſon further urged. n. 12, though ſilently paſſed over by Mr Dr.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:93042:157"/>7. Chap: 8. I shew how <hi>efficacious Church</hi> miracles have been in after Ages, and moreover prove, that thoſe who deny them ſtrive againſt God, and do their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <note place="margin">Of what efficacy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are.</note> to render the Converſion of Iewes and Infidels, not only difficult but impoſſible, and I ſpeak of ſuch Miracles as have been wrought <hi>by the Profeſſors of the Roman Catholick Church,</hi> ever reputed Orthodox from the Apoſtles time. In confirmation whereof, I produce firſt S. Irenaeus <hi>Adverſus Haereticos. Lib.</hi> 2. C. 57. <hi>Some,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>caſt out Divels, others foretel things to come, others by laying their hands on the Sick cure them. Now alſo, as we ſaid, the dead have alſo riſen, and lived with us for many yeares. In his. 6. Chapter,</hi> he aſſures us, that this Grace of working Miracles belong's only to the Catholick Church, and ſaith, Hereticks never <hi>reſtored ſight to the blind,</hi> nor ſtrength to the lame, nor wrought any ſuch <hi>true Miracles in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their Goſpel.</hi> I produced alſo S. Baſil ſpeaking of that worthy Bishop of <hi>Neocaeſarea</hi> S. Gregory, deſervedly called <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturgus,</hi> who removed à Mountain from the place it was in, and none ever yet doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or queſtioned the admirable works of this <note place="margin">Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers moſt plain for Miracles wrought in the Church</note> glorious Saint. S. Athanaſius and S. Hierome amply relate the Miracles of S. Hilarion, as Severus Sulpitius doth the wonders of S. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Bishop of Tours in France. And the ſame S. Hierome. <hi>Lib. adverſas Vigilan: c.</hi> 4. ſaith, that the Signs and wonders wrought in the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93042:157"/> Temples of Martyrs prove highly beneficial both to Believers, and the Increduious. S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe <hi>Epiſt:</hi> 85 was an Eye-witneſs of ſtrange Miracles done by the Reliques of S. Gervaſius and Protaſius, for proof whereof he appeal's to the ſenſe and judgement of thoſe who ſaw them. <hi>You have known, ſaith he, nay you have ſeen many diſpoſſeſſed of Divels, many when they touched the Garments of Saints, freed from their Infirmities. S. Auſtin. Lib: 22 de Civitat: c.</hi> 8. is moſt copious in relating the Miracles wrought by the glorious Martyr S. Stephen; And Lib: <hi>contra Epiſt. Fundam. cap.</hi> 4. 5. aſſert's that the true Church of Chriſt, is proved and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated <note place="margin">S. Auſtins judgement.</note> by Miracles.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Theſe moſt evident Teſtimonies which evince glorious Miracles to have been wrought in the Church diſtinct from thoſe regiſtred in <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> our wiſe D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> takes little notice of, though I clearly laid them before his eyes with à further enlargement on every particular, and expected an Anſwer, But in <hi>lieu</hi> of this he bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes me, be cauſe I shew our Saviours Prediction of more <hi>numerous and greater Miracles exactly fulfilled.</hi> I could wish he had peruſed better S. Chriſoſtom's whole Book againſt the Pagans. <hi>Tomo</hi> 5. where ſpeaking of <hi>S. Babylas</hi> Martyr, he shew's that our Saviour's Prophecy was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed, <note place="margin">What the Dr Cavil's as.</note> not only in the cures wrought by <hi>S. Peters shadow and S. Pauls garments,</hi> but moreover by the Reliques and Monuments of Saints, namely <hi>S. Babylas,</hi> and from thence infer's that Chriſt is God, who did <hi>ſuch wonders by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi> But all this ſignifies nothing to the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93042:158"/> though Chriſt our Lord expreſly ſaith, <hi>that his Saints should doe greater things; than himſelf had done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. Afterward I referred the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> to our Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Bede, both learned and virtuous, for the undoubted Miracles of <hi>S. Cuthbert,</hi> and many others in England; then <hi>n.</hi> 6. I appealed to S. Bernard, who I hope may paſſ for an honeſt man in his relation <hi>of S. Malachies life. He had,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Bernard, the Gift of Propheſy, cured the ſick, changed mens minds to the better, and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Not a word to S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Dr.</note> 
                        <hi>rayſed the dead to life.</hi> Again. Here I alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced S. Bernards own Miracles, with the wonders of two other glorious Saints, <hi>S. Dominick</hi> and <hi>the Seraphical S. Francis,</hi> againſt whom the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſpitt's à little venome, but hurts neither. Next to be brief (for I cannot here tranſcribe that whole 8 <hi>chapter)</hi> I touched upon the undubitable Miracles wrought in ſeveral places of Chriſtendom, <hi>Loreto, Compoſtella, Montaigue</hi> &amp;c. And finally concluded <hi>n.</hi> 18. with that admirable known cure wrought by Bleſſed <note place="margin">Nor of the Miracles moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently wrought as Montague.</note> 
                        <hi>S. Xaverius upon F. Marcellus Maſtrilli</hi> in the City of Naples; as alſo. <hi>c.</hi> 9. with another evident Miracle at <hi>Zaragoſa</hi> in Spain, both done in our Memory. And though in my laſt Treatiſe I urged the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> to return an anſwer to theſe two known <hi>matters of fact,</hi> divulged the whole world over, yet his heart failed to <hi>meddle ſeriouſly with either,</hi> and replyes nothing but what is to his shame, as will appear afterward.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 Now before I come to weigh the Dr's weak Arguments, I will plainly diſcover ſome chiefe enormous frauds and intolerable cheats
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93042:158"/> (one may rightly call them poyſonable Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients) which he contrary to Conſcience hath caſt into his whole Treatiſe, with intention to beguile an unwary Reader.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 One palpable cheat is, that he never <note place="margin">A long ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, of the Drs frauds, and open Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>ts.</note> diſtinguishes between the received <hi>Miracles of the Church,</hi> and thoſe which particular men relate, whereof ſome are <hi>only probable, others dubious,</hi> and <hi>others falſe:</hi> Theſe he differences not, but makes all fish that comes to his net. A Story told by <hi>Iames Finaughty,</hi> or <hi>Golganus,</hi> weigh's as much with him as the moſt Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Miracle recorded by <hi>S. Irenaeus,</hi> or <hi>S. Auſtin.</hi> Hence when he touches upon à leſſe certain Miracle, he often cloſes his diſcourſe with this nauſeous repetition. <hi>And what is this comparable to the works of Chriſt and his Apoſtles?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12 By Church Miracles, I firſt underſtand ſuch as the moſt ancient Fathers have left upon record, never Queſtioned, never called into doubt by any. Theſe are innumerable, ſome few and clear ones, I ſet down. <hi>Reas: and Relig:</hi> already cited, but the Dr in à ſurly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour <note place="margin">What is meant by Church Miracles.</note> galled with their Evidence, ſilently paſſes by them, not knowing what to reply. 2. I underſtand by Church Miracles ſuch as in latter Ages have been approved by the <hi>See Apoſtolick,</hi> chiefly at the Canonization of Saints, whereof witneſſes have been produced <hi>upon oath,</hi> and all imaginable Sincerity, (or Severity rather) uſed to avoid Impoſtures, and to make truth openly known. Theſe and the forenamed Miracles our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> unworthily account's as unvalvable, as every feigned ſtory he rakes out of this or that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93042:159"/> private Author. Though Iohn an Oakes, or <hi>Haſenmullerus</hi> tell it, all with him paſſes for à Church Miracle.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. A ſecond cheat run's through his whole ill contrived diſcourſe, which is to perſwade the Reader, that the moſt learned and Holy Fathers of God's Church, who plainly aſſert Miracles to have been wrought by the choiſeſt Servants in it, <hi>are open Impoſtors, and manifeſt</hi>

Hear now my reply. But <hi>S. Irenaeus, S. Ambroſe, S.

                        <p n="7">7. TO proceed clearly. Firſt its evident that à little Houſe or Chappel, has ſtood at Loreto without Prop, ſupport, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration well nigh the ſpace of four hundred yeares, and its much, that <hi>an old houſe,</hi> as the Dr <hi>Scornfully calls it,</hi> should remain ſo long unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable, and have no material Foundations to ſtand upon. 2. Its evident, that this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93042:165"/> Chappel was <hi>never firſt built at Loreto by any hands,</hi> for grant this, the report of its <note place="margin">Evidences for the Chappels Tranſlation.</note> being <hi>tranſlated thither, would have been blaſted, thought à cheat, and made ridiculous the whole world over.</hi> All would have ſaid. in ſuch à year, by ſuch à Benefactor, this Chappel was erected as appear's upon record, and ſome eyes who ſaw it built there, would have left à memory of it to Poſterity, which <note place="margin">Of the great veneration given to the Chappel.</note> would ſoon have taken off all reſpect and veneration to the place. Whereas, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is evident, Popes, Princes, Prelates, Great ones and wiſe, rich and poor, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and Turks, highly reverence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the place, and therefore have enriched it with many noble Donaries. Were all theſe men think yee worſe then beſotted, when they parted with their Goods to honour à few bare ſtones which à companie of Briklayers about Loreto, ſome time or other, heaped together, and made à houſe of? Again, who ever built à houſe or Chappel without material Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations? This Sacred Chappel hath none, but ſtand's upon it's own weight without Support and ſo alſo it ſtood in Dalmatia. 3. <note place="margin">This 3. vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his 2.

                           <hi>Nazareth</hi> with command to enquire, whether this houſe yet remained there or no?

                        <p n="12">12. Three yeares and ſeven months the Chappel remained in Dalmatia, when behold, towards the middle of December, that is <hi>Anno</hi> 1294. it paſſed over the <hi>Adriatick ſea,</hi> and came <hi>to Picenum</hi> à part of Italy, and there placed in à wood belonging to à pious Matrone of <hi>Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati,</hi> called <hi>Laureta,</hi> had from her the name of <hi>Loreto.</hi> The Shepherds who kept their watch both day and night, firſt made à diſcovery of <note place="margin">Where it was placed afterward?</note> it by à clear light, that environed the place.

                        <p n="13">13. The proofs whereof are evident.

                     <p n="4">4. In the year 1517. there appeared in Germany à very ſtrange Machine (our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> will have it well nigh as old as the Chappel at Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto) called by ſome, <hi>if not the whole,</hi> at <hi>least the best Part of the Houſe</hi> of the living God, <hi>that is, his Church,</hi> which should (had it been built by Jeſus Chriſt) be more worth then à <hi>little Chappel.</hi> Not to keep you longer in <hi>Suſpence,</hi> I mean by this <hi>Machine</hi> the whole <hi>Eſſential Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick</hi>

                     <p n="5">5.

Now further. But no ancient Writer ever told the world
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93042:174"/> where this Proteſtancy had been <hi>before Luther,</hi> or from what remote Part of the world it <hi>firſt came,</hi> or finally, who firſt tranſported it <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Germany,</hi> therefore according to the Dr's rule, <hi>it juſtly deſerves contempt.</hi> Shall I ſpeak <note place="margin">Who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed this new Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy into Germany and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</note> more plainly?

                     <p n="7">7. Now to the Obiection propoſed above, I anſwer. Had none within the compaſſe of that <hi>fourth Century</hi> after the year 1000, left à memory of this Chappels Tranſlation, the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of <hi>Dantes, Petrach,</hi> and <hi>Boccace</hi> would <note place="margin">The Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed above, anſwered.</note> have had more weight, but when, as <hi>Silv: Petr: Sanct:</hi> P. 35. notes well, Three Popes. <hi>Benedict the 12, Vrban the</hi> 6, and <hi>Boniface the</hi> 9, much about that time poſitively maintain the truth of this Miracle, as appear's by their <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical letters,</hi> the Silence of thoſe others, being meerly à <hi>Negative Argument,</hi> prejudiceth not the cauſe at all.

                     <p n="1">1. TO inſiſt in this place upon the evident known Miracles wrought by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Bleſſed Virgin at Loreto, or to mention the Donaries offered there as <hi>Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of gratitude,</hi> would be only à Tranſcription of what Turſellin, and other writers have am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply performed to my hands.

To relate all or halfe, would require à Volume.

One related by <hi>Turſellin. lib.</hi> 2. c. 18. is briefly thus.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A certain Prieſt of Dalmatia taken by the Turks was urged to renounce his Religion, but <hi>would not,</hi> ſtill calling upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Sacred Virgin,</hi> whereupon the barbarous Turks threatned to pull out his bowels if he did not <hi>curſe them both,</hi> which by no threats he would do, but contrarywiſe made à vow to <hi>our Lady</hi> at Loreto, that if he lived he would goe thither in Pilgrimage. In à word, they open'd his breſt,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93042:187"/> pulled out his Entrails, put them into his hands <note place="margin">A Miracle Wrought upon à Prieſt of Dalmatia.</note> and bid him be gone. The Prieſt went away, and after many daies journey came to Loreto, shewed there <hi>his open breſt and entrails</hi> in his hands to the Officers of the Chappel, gave thanks to the Virgin Mother, made his confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, received the Bleſſed Sacrament, <hi>and dyed there. The Entrails were hung up in the Chappel till they were nigh conſumed.</hi> You may ſee the reſt of the Story in <hi>Turſellin,</hi> now cited. <hi>is not this à</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A viſible proof of the Miracle.</note> 
                        <hi>Swinging Miracle, ſaith our Dr?</hi> Pray you mark what à Swinging anſwer he return's to it. To ask, ſaith he, how à man can breath without his lungs, or live without à heart, or by what veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels the Circulation of bloud was performed, <note place="margin">The Dr's ſimple Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</note> were but to gratify <hi>Carnal reaſon too much,</hi> and he ſaies well, for juſt ſo an Atheiſt to gratify <hi>Carnal reaſon,</hi> might propoſe as wiſe à Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and ask. How <hi>Moſes. Exod.</hi> 3. Saw à bush burn without being conſumed, for this as much tranſcend's the force of Nature, as to ſe à man breath without his lungs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith is required, <hi>Humane faith in one caſe, Divine in the other. Marry,</hi> ſaith the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> (and here is his ſwinging reply) <hi>men muſt certainly have great ſtore of faith, or folly rather and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that dare call theſe Legends by the name of Authentick Testimonies.</hi> Is not this, think ye, à profound refutation of à Teſtimony <hi>ſo evident,</hi> that <hi>Turſellin</hi> hold's it à <hi>ſin to doubt of it.</hi> I ſay <hi>Evident,</hi> all circumſtances conſidered, however be it leſs, the Dr's anſwer is childish, which amount's to this. <hi>He either will not, or</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The Dr and Atheiſts argue alike.</note> 
                        <hi>cannot believe the Story, Ergo it is falſe?</hi> After this ſtrain, should an Atheiſt ſay. I neither
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93042:188"/> will not can believe the Miracles in Scripture, he would prove as well (that's nothing at all) thoſe Miracles to be falſe, as the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> doth this, for all he brings againſt it, is only his <hi>own bare and blunt denial,</hi> and cannot an Atheiſt be as blunt as he? O! but Scripture Miracles are better grounded. What then? That help's not the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> at all, for here we parallel not the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Scripture Miracles conſidered <hi>in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> with others believed upon Humane <note place="margin">What it is, we impugn in the Dr.</note> faith, but compare <hi>this Dr's ſimple Impugnation</hi> with <hi>that of Atheists,</hi> and ſay they are both alike, ridiculous, foolish, and weightleſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> goes on. <hi>There are very few Perſons in the World but at ſome time or other of their lives, do meet with extraordinary deliverances, either from diseaſes, or other dangers. If any of theſe had gone to Loreto, and there acquainted the Panitentiary with it, it had been entered into the Tables and preſerved (as à Tooth-drawer doth teeth) for the reputation of the place.</hi> I ſet down theſe <note place="margin">A flat Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny.</note> ungodly words, to shew you the virulent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of this man, who in ſtead of proving, rail's, and Calumniat's, for its well known that no Miracles enter the Tables at Loreto, or any other holy place, but ſuch only as after moſt rigid examination are prudently judged, not <hi>caſual deliverances,</hi> but works above the force of nature. Read <hi>Turſellin lib. 3. c.</hi> 25. and ſee how Miraculouſly à young woman of <hi>Sienna, ſtark blinde,</hi> and wholly deſpaired of by Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, recovered her perfect ſight in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of many, while she devoutly prayed to our Lady in the Chappel of Loreto. <hi>Raphael Riera</hi> ſet's down the Miracle, and ſaies he was
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93042:188"/> preſent when God did the wonder. Can this, which moſt deſervedly entred the publick Tables, be called one of the Dr's <hi>extraordinary</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Was the blinde Mans Cure in the Goſpel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted only an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance?</note> 
                        <hi>Deliverances?</hi> If ſo, why was not the blinde Mans cure wrought by our Saviour. <hi>Iohn the</hi> 9. Undervalued by the Jewes, and thought only an <hi>extraordinary Deliverance,</hi> but no Miracle, becauſe the Spirit of Atheiſm will have it ſo.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. In the next place our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> fiercely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the Miracle wrought upon <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the ſecond, an old man broken with Labours, and <note place="margin">The Miracle wrought upon Pope Pius.</note> beſides, much afflicted with à dangerous Cough, and à burning Feaver. The good Pope as <hi>Turſellin</hi> relates. <hi>Lib. 1. c.</hi> 26. having offered his Gift of à weighty golden Chalice to our Lady at Loreto, and made à Vow to viſit the place, <hi>implored</hi> by earneſt prayer, the bleſſed Virgins favour for his <hi>ſpeedy recovery.</hi> No ſooner had he done ſo, ſaith <hi>Turſellin,</hi> but his Feaver in à moment went off, the troubleſome cough left him, his weak and feeble limbs worn away with à long Infirmity regained Strength, <hi>and this very ſuddenly. Pius</hi> therefore willing to comply with his vow, undertook his journey towards <note place="margin">The Pope ſuddenly Cured.</note> 
                        <hi>Ancona,</hi> and <hi>Loreto,</hi> and the neerer he drew to <hi>Loreto,</hi> the better he found himſelfe in health, being there ſtrong and well able, he performed his promiſe, and from thence went to <hi>Ancona,</hi> where (old as he was) he ſtayed in the Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heats expecting the <hi>Commander</hi> of the Venetian Navy, but at laſt wearied out with delay and age together, relapſed into his Feaver, and there dyed. Here our D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> begins to flutter. <hi>Call you this à Miracle? I know not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what kind of Miracles the Lady of Loreto works, I am
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93042:189"/> ſure Chriſt and his Apostles never wrought ſuch.</hi> You erre grosſly Mr D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> the. <note place="margin">The like Miracle wrought by our Saviour.</note> 4. 38.

But ſaith the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Away the Pope goes for Ancona and there dies of his feaver, and is dying of à diſeaſe à Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Cure?</hi> Here he cheat's egregiouſly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe à very conſiderable time paſſed between the Popes recovery and his death, as is clearly gathered from <hi>Turſellins</hi> whole Naration, therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, <note place="margin">How the Dr Cheat's.</note> unleſs the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> would have an old decayed man to live alwaies, I know not what he would ſay. Again, ſuppoſe that an accident cauſed by the heats at <hi>Ancona,</hi> and à weariſom expecting Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers there had taken away the Popes life ſooner, can this impair the <hi>clear evidence of the Miracle done?</hi> Pray you imagin, that ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary heat had bereaved <hi>Lazarus</hi> of life à whole Month after he roſe from the dead, or, that one by chance had put out the eyes of the blinde Man, cured by our Saviour; would either the one or the other <hi>Croſs Caſvality</hi> have made Chriſt's Miracles leſſe famous, void, or <note place="margin">The Cheat made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by two Inſtances.</note> uneffectual? Yet thus the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> diſcourſes while he ſaies à <hi>Miracle is à perfect work, and that dying of à diseaſe is not Miraculous,</hi> never reflecting on the reſpite of time, or the unexpected Accident which intervened between the <hi>Popes Cure,</hi> and <hi>his death.</hi> Theſe circumſtances (and it was for the Dr's purpoſe to embellish the cheat) he ſilently paſſes over, and too nimbly tell's us. <hi>Away the Pope goes for Ancona, and there dies of his Feaver.</hi>

Saith Turſellin, none perhaps of the ancient writers mentioned the Tranſlation, becauſe <hi>as yet it was not approved, or confirmed by the Popes Authority.</hi> The wonder therefore of à houſe carried from one Part of the world to another being ſo uncouth and ſtrange, they prudently waved it, <hi>leaſt they should ſeem to utter vain and incredible things.
